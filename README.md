# A Flock of Swifts 

A Flock of Swifts is a physical space meeting of like-minded people excited about the Swift language.  We normally meet each Saturday morning.  Here is our meetup page.  All people and all skill levels are welcome to join.

John is exploring swift package manager: https://swift.org/package-manager/
Josh worked on displaying a chain of CFilters in a MTKView: https://github.com/joshuajhomann/Core-Image-Metal-View

Coding challenges for all levels if anyone is interested in trying: https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/

The deadline is fast approaching.  Update your apps with a launch storyboard and support for arbitrary screen sizes.
```As announced at WWDC19, starting April 2020, apps submitted to the App Store must use an Xcode storyboard to provide the appâ€™s launch screen and must have an interface that supports any display size.```

CIFilter example:
```
import PlaygroundSupport
import UIKit

let ciImage = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "dog", withExtension: "jpg")
  .flatMap { try! Data(contentsOf:$0) }
  .flatMap(UIImage.init(data:))?
  .cgImage
  .flatMap(CIImage.init(cgImage:))!

let blur = CIFilter(name: "CIGaussianBlur")
blur?.setValue(ciImage, forKey: kCIInputImageKey)
blur?.setValue(16, forKey: "inputRadius")
let uncroppedImage = (blur?.value(forKey: kCIOutputImageKey) as? CIImage)
  .flatMap(UIImage.init(ciImage:))!
let croppedImage = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: ciImage!.extent.size).image { _ in
  uncroppedImage.draw(at: .init(
    x: (ciImage!.extent.size.width - uncroppedImage.size.width) / 2,
    y: (ciImage!.extent.size.height - uncroppedImage.size.height) / 2
  ))
}
```

John working on button customization using a view modifier.  I suggested creating a `ButtonModifier` because you can get at the button.

```swift
struct RectangularButtonStyle: ButtonStyle {

  func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
    configuration.label.frame(width: 150, height: 50)
      .background(Color.blue)
      .foregroundColor(.white)
      .font(.subheadline)
      .cornerRadius(10)
    
  } 
}

// Use it like this:

Button("Press Me!") {
  print("Hello")
}.buttonStyle(RectangularButtonStyle())

```


Josh and Ray working on SwiftUI navigation.

Some background links:

### Basic SwiftUI Navigation
https://www.raywenderlich.com/5824937-swiftui-tutorial-navigation

### Deep Linking (Uses AppState to control navigation)
https://nalexn.github.io/swiftui-deep-linking/
This uses `AppState` to figure out how views set themselves up.

### Combine Tutorial Navigation
https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios
Combine tutorial which contains some info on "pragmatic navigation" using a view builder function.

### Starter Project from Josh
This uses the TVMaze API that creates a simple navigation.
https://github.com/joshuajhomann/TVMaze-SwiftUI-Navigation

Adding a coordinator turns out to be a little less straightforward than originally thought.

- Simon Simon worked on SwiftUI navigation.  We hit a bug where you can't push a view after it has been dismissed.  This is really weird.

```swift
struct DetailView: View {

    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentation

    var body: some View {
        Button("Done") {
            self.presentation.wrappedValue.dismiss()
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Hello")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Any ideas?

--EDIT: Josh--

John and I worked on the same issue a few weeks ago.  The solution is to use a binding for the navigationLink.  If you think about it its wierd to be manipulating the global presentation state since whether or not a view is presented is a piece of local state that someone should own (in this case that someone is the parent).

```swift
struct DetailView: View {
  @Binding var isShown: Bool
  var body: some View {
    Button("done") {
      self.isShown = false
    }
  }
}

struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var isDetailShown = false
  var body: some View {
    NavigationView {
      NavigationLink("hello", destination: DetailView(isShown: $isDetailShown), isActive: $isDetailShown)
    }
  }
}
```
--END EDIT--

Ray:  Actually this also does not work. If you go back using the back button, you can no longer push onto the navigation stack.  (At least in the 13.3 sim).  Ray Posted feedback to Apple FB7522002


- Victoria worked on SpriteKit and attempted to commit her code with Gitup.  She understands the importance of version control but isn't a fan of the current product offerings.

## 2019.12.21 [A Geeky Swiftmas Party]

Making Ornaments, snacks, drinks (moldly drinks!), iPad Pictionary, a presentation, discussion. 

Five Swift things to be excited about in 2020.

- SwiftUI and Combine
- Swift on the Server
- Swift for Machine Learning (TensorFlow)
- The vibrant Swift community
- Our community

Brainstorm ideas for 2020.

- Analyze buoy data in relation to tsunamis
- Build a game for Apple Arcade (or find out what it takes)
- Build a self driving car (Use Swift for TensorFlow)
- Build a Draw and Guess Game

## 2019.12.14 [New Beginnings]

- Discussion  of Markov Chains, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

- Ray starting aflockofswifts github organization.  See me (ray) IRL if you want to join the organization.  

- Josh and John are working on a SwiftUI version of Boggle.  https://github.com/joshuajhomann/Boggle-SwiftUI

- John and Josh used `UITextChecker` to validate the dictionary which contained 250k invalid words.  Seems to be slow, it takes 5 minutes to process the 300k dictionary.  Cleaned up dictionary opens fast in iOS but crashes in catalyst (???)

- Xcode 11.3 seems to have trouble opening a large json array. Hangs. (Reported to Apple as FB7493904)

- Bill wants to know how to use hash tags in his instagram profile (Not Swift related but hey...)

- Simon is working of SwiftUI layout with video player.  Also used `Bundle.main` to fetch a local video rather than streaming from the web.

- Victoria is going through a SpriteKit tutorial  

- Swiftforgood.com Book is on pre-order.

### Some Code

`PrefixTree` is a trie that provides fast lookup in the English dictionary for a valid word.  Here is the key method:

```swift
     func contains(_ collection: SomeCollection) -> Bool {
        collection.reduce(into: self, { $0 = $0?.children[$1]})?.isTerminal == true
     }
```

### Required init issue

A short coming in the current version of Swift is that even if you have a `final class` if you reference and init a `Self` you *MUST* have a `required` initializer.  It seems like it should not be `required` if the class is `final`.
