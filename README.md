### Getting and Setting Colors

Monty had a question about getting the hue, saturation, and brightness from a SwiftUI Color that he had already set.

Josh used a playground to demonstrate the relationship between SwiftUI colors, CGColors, and UIColor. Some serious API archeology happening here! ðŸ˜„

```
import SwiftUI
import UIKit
import PlaygroundSupport
    
    
let swiftuiColor = Color(hue: 0.668944, saturation: 1.0, brightness: 0.267304)
let cgColor = swiftuiColor.cgColor
let uiColor = UIColor(cgColor: cgColor!)
    
var (h,s,v,a) = (CGFloat.zero,CGFloat(1.0),CGFloat(1.0),CGFloat(1.0))
    
print(uiColor.getHue(&h, saturation: &s, brightness: &v, alpha: &a))
    
print(h,s,v,a)
```


### Weather API

Another question Monty had was about using WeatherKit to get sunrise and sunset.  You can use wheter kit to do this with SunEvents.  

- https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10003/
- https://betterprogramming.pub/wwdc22-get-started-with-weatherkit-202794853c01

You can also use a free API:

https://sunrise-sunset.org/api

You can do your own "cleanroom" implementation that can be computed locally.

### Ad Hoc Database

Ed took us on a journey about using dictionaries to implement fast lookup to a local database.

We talked about everything from sets to the demise of C-style for loops.

### Puyopuyo Continued

Josh continued his epic example creating Puyo puyo in iOS17 SwiftUI, which will probably complete next week with the collapse of puyo towers! ðŸ˜‚

### Universal Scene Description Demo

Carlyn is implementing the USD format from scratch in Swift. You can find a flurry of blog posts on her blog: https://www.whynotestflight.com


She showed this JavaScript library that does similar thing to what she wants to do: https://p5js.org

A big part of the library is using ResultBuilder. Josh did a presentation on this last year. This is his template 

```swift
@resultBuilder
    struct <#Name#>Builder {
        typealias Expression = <#Expression#>
        typealias Component = <#Component#>
        typealias FinalResult = <#FinalResult#>
    
        static func buildBlock(_ components: Component...) -> Component {
            buildArray(components)
        }
        static func buildExpression(_ expression: Expression) -> Component {
    
        }
        static func buildOptional(_ component: Component?) -> Component {
            component ?? <#empty#>
        }
        static func buildEither(first component: Component) -> Component {
            component
        }
        static func buildEither(second component: Component) -> Component {
            component
        }
        static func buildArray(_ components: [Component]) -> Component {
    
        }
        static func buildLimitedAvailability(_ component: Component) -> Component {
            component
        }
        static func buildFinalResult(_ component: Component) -> FinalResult {
    
        }
    }

```

### Migratable Codable

Ed had some discussion on making codable formats that can migrate. Here is code from Josh proposed:

```swift
final class A {
        var integer: Integer
        init(dictionary: [Swift.String: Any]) {
            integer = .init(dictionary: dictionary.compactMapValues { $0 as? Int})
        }
        @dynamicMemberLookup
        struct Integer {
            var dictionary: [Swift.String: Int]  
            subscript(dynamicMember member: Swift.String) -> Int {
                dictionary[member] ?? 0
            }
        }
        @dynamicMemberLookup
        struct String {
            var dictionary: [Swift.String: Swift.String]  
            subscript(dynamicMember member: Swift.String) -> Swift.String {
                dictionary[member] ?? ""
            }
        }
}
    
let a = A(dictionary: ["a": "a", "b": 1])
print(a.integer.b)
```

### Welcome Monty

New to iOS programming. Currently doing a UDEMY course but several people say he would be
better off doing 100 days of SwiftUI.

Discussed his passion project: calendar app for cognitively impaired. Some advice:

- Try out SwiftUI
- Draw out your UI on paper
- 100 days of SwiftUI https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui
- Guided Access https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados

### Realm and Mongo Atlas

- https://atlasmadness.devpost.com
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB_Inc
- https://aws-quickstart.github.io/quickstart-mongodb-atlas/ â€” notes a three-node cluster minimum for a replica set for high availability, but it does not say it *must* be replicated across regions. 

### Layout Problems with Geometry Reader

Mark trying to make a list that can control row spacing. Attempts at using GeometryReader seemed to break lineLimit modifiers. He tried putting the GeometryReader in the overlay but it didn't help. Brainstorm advice was to not use List (and implement Edit functionality) or to use Layout.

### Curve continuity
Josh discussed [Squircles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle) and C1 [continuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness) and saw how the squircle differs from a rounded rect:
```swift
import SwiftUI
import PlaygroundSupport

struct V: View {
    var body: some View {
        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 250, style: .circular)
            .fill(.yellow)
            .overlay(
                RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 250, style: .continuous)
                    .fill(.blue.opacity(0.5))
            )
            .aspectRatio(1, contentMode: .fill)
            .padding()
    }
}

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(V())
```

### WWDC Roundup

We talked about what we thought was cool from WWDC. This site collects notes from WW.

 - https://wwdcnotes.com/events/wwdc23/


Some Favorite features:

  - TipKit (works with UIKit too)
  - Macros (and all they enable)
  - Xcode Documentation Previews
  - Widgets, Siri Integration, Intents
  - Logging Console in Xcode
  - Better autocompletion
  - Improvements to scroll views
  - Sensitive Content Analysis

  Josh is worried about how the new Observation feature in SwiftUI works with testing.

## 2023.05.27

Primary `associatedtype`s, existentials and opaque types: why you should care
With a type that has primary associatedtypes we can use the existential `any` to erase the type at the contract level:
```swift
struct Item { }
	
	protocol Repository {
	    func getItems() -> any Publisher<[Item], Never>
	}
	
	
	final class EmptyRepository: Repository {
	    func getItems() -> any Publisher<[Item], Never> {
	        Just([])
	    }
	}
	
	
	final class NeverRepository: Repository {
	    func getItems() -> any Publisher<[Item], Never> {
	        Empty(completeImmediately: false)
	    }
	}
	
```
But if we try the same thing with the opaque type it doesn't work because the compiler cannot infer a single concrete type for `some Publisher<Item, Never>`
```swift
	protocol Repository {
        // This doesn't compile
	    func getItems() ->  some Publisher<[Item], Never>
	}
	
	
	final class EmptyRepository: Repository {
	    func getItems() -> some Publisher<[Item], Never> {
	        Just([])
	    }
	}
```
The solution is to use a generic:
```swift
	protocol Repository {
	    associatedtype GetItemPublisher: Publisher<[Item], Never>
	    func getItems() -> GetItemPublisher
	}
	
	
	final class EmptyRepository: Repository {
	    func getItems() -> some Publisher<[Item], Never> {
	        Just([])
	    }
	}
	
	
	final class NeverRepository: Repository {
	    func getItems() -> some Publisher<[Item], Never> {
	        Empty(completeImmediately: false)
	    }
	}
```
While either the existential or the associatedtype + opaque type work for types with primary associatedtypes like Publisher, only the associatedtype + opaque type works for types without primary associatedtypes like AsyncSequence:
```swift
protocol AsyncRepository<Element> {
	    associatedtype Element
	    associatedtype GetItemAsyncSequence: AsyncSequence where GetItemAsyncSequence.Element == Element
	    func getItems() -> GetItemAsyncSequence
	}
	
	struct AsyncEmptyRepository: AsyncRepository {
	    typealias Element = [Item]
	    func getItems() -> AsyncPrefixSequence<AsyncStream<[Item]>> {
	        AsyncStream { [] }.prefix(1)
	    }
	}
	
	struct AsyncNeverRepository: AsyncRepository {
	    typealias Element = [Item]
	    func getItems() -> AsyncStream<[Item]> {
	        AsyncStream { nil }
	    }
	}
```

}

extension EnvironmentValues {
    var viewSize: CGSize {
        get { self[ViewSizeEnvironmentKey.self] }

                .frame(width: proxy.size.width, height: proxy.size.height, alignment: alignment)
        }
    }
}

extension View {
    func measure(alignment: Alignment = .center) -> some View {
        modifier(MeasureModifier(alignment: alignment))
    }
}

    @Published var selectedTab: String
    @Published var selectedItem: String?
    let items = ["star", "circle", "checkmark"]
    init() {
        selectedTab = items[0]
        selectedItem = items[0]
        $selectedTab.removeDuplicates().map { $0 as String? }.assign(to: &$selectedItem)
        $selectedItem.removeDuplicates().compactMap { $0 }.assign(to: &$selectedTab)

                    Image(systemName: item)

### Followups from Rainer

- Two line buttons don't work well. Instead he needed to use a view with a tap gesture and was able to put it in nested scroll views.
- Looking at using a base class and derived class instead of a protocol with associated types. Josh warned him it might not be as good as sticking with a protocol.
- Using transform compositions to translate and rotate points.

### Transitions From Ed

Rather than using transitions mentioned last week, Ed pursued another solution. We worked on it together to simplify how it ran.

Some notes: 


```swift
import SwiftUI

struct BackImage: View {
  let index: Int
  let size: CGSize
  @State var opacity = 0.0
  var x: Double {
    Double.random(in: 0..<1) * size.width - 60.0
  }
  var y: Double {
    Double.random(in: 0..<1) * size.height - 60.0
  }
  var delay: TimeInterval {
    0.001 * Double(index)
  }
  var body: some View {
    Image(systemName: "star.fill")
      .resizable()
      .foregroundColor(index.isMultiple(of: 2) ? .blue : .yellow)
      .frame(width: 120, height: 120)
      .offset(x: x, y: y)
      .opacity(opacity)
      .animation(.easeIn.delay(delay).speed(0.25),
                 value: opacity)
      .task {
        opacity = 1
      }
  }
}

struct BackView: View {
  var body: some View {
    GeometryReader { proxy in
      ForEach(0..<250, id: \.self) { index in
        BackImage(index: index, size: proxy.size)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Bard and Pong

Josh tested out Google's AI Bard to make the game Pong. The result 
kind of worked but was a little bit dicey in how it tried to render the view.

ChatGPT seems to be better at writing Swift code at the moment but be sure to
use 4, otherwise you get older, less idiomatic Swift.

### Representing an optional as an array

```swift
import Foundation
	
let a: Int? = nil
	
extension Optional {
    var asArray: [Wrapped] {
        map { [$0] } ?? []
    }
}
print(a.asArray)
```

Another alternative (TMTOWTDI):

```swift
[b].compactMap { $0 }
```

This approach is more "compact" (haha) but can require two allocations where the first way is always a single allocation.


### Identifiable

Watch out that you don't have duplicate IDs or you will confuse the pants off of SwiftUI.


### Wheel of Fortune Demo

Josh created a Wheel of Fortune using SwiftUI drawing groups for performance.  Rotations effect applied do the magic of creating wedges in the proper place and spinning the wheel.

```swift

final class WheelViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var items: [Item] = []
    @Published private(set) var angle: Angle = .zero
    @Published private(set) var winner = ""
    private let names: [String]
    private var winningIndex = 0
    let arcLength: Double
    init() {
        let colors: [UIColor] = [#colorLiteral(red: 0.8039215803, green: 0.8039215803, blue: 0.8039215803, alpha: 1), #colorLiteral(red: 0.9058823529, green: 0.9058823529, blue: 0.9058823529, alpha: 1), #colorLiteral(red: 0.6434109211, green: 0.625438869, blue: 0.6250535846, alpha: 1),]
        let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "list", withExtension: "csv")
        let data = try! Data(contentsOf: url!)
        let text = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)!
        names = text
            .components(separatedBy: .newlines)
            .filter { !$0.isEmpty }
            .lazy
            .map { $0.localizedCapitalized }
            .reduce(into: Set<String>()) { $0.insert($1) }
            .sorted(by: <)
        let count = Double(names.count)
        arcLength = (2 * .pi) / count
        items = names
            .enumerated()
            .map { offset, name in
                .init(
                    name: name.description,
                    color: Color(uiColor: colors[offset % colors.count]),
                    rotation: .radians(Double(offset) * arcLength - 0.5 * .pi)
                )
            }
    }

    func tap() {
        winningIndex = names.indices.randomElement() ?? 0

Josh showed a similar playground using `UIViewRepresentable` and the `UIResponder` chain to walk up the chain and mutate a UIKit type from within SwiftUI:
```swift
import UIKit
import SwiftUI
import PlaygroundSupport

struct ProxyView: UIViewRepresentable {
    var onMoveToWindow: (UIView) -> Void
    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> Proxy { .init() }
    func updateUIView(_ proxy: Proxy, context: Context) {
        proxy.onMoveToWindow = onMoveToWindow
    }
    final class Proxy: UIView {
        var onMoveToWindow: ((UIView) -> Void)?
        override func didMoveToWindow() {
            super.didMoveToWindow()
            guard window != nil else { return }
            backgroundColor = .clear
            onMoveToWindow?(self)
        }
    }
}

extension View {
    func modifyNavigationBar(perform: @escaping (UINavigationBar) -> Void) -> some View {
        background(ProxyView {
            sequence(first: $0) { $0.next }
                .lazy
                .compactMap { $0 as? UINavigationController }
                .first { _ in true }
                .map(\.navigationBar)
                .map(perform)
        })
    }
}

struct V: View {
    @ViewBuilder
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            NavigationLink("Push me") {
                Text("Color changed")
                    .navigationTitle("I have a red bar")
                    .modifyNavigationBar { bar in
                        bar.titleTextAttributes = [.foregroundColor : UIColor.white]
                        bar.backgroundColor = .red
                    }

### Switching Between Different Xcodes

John had some questions about Xcode versions. Alex said he used this app to help with the command line
`xcode-select -s` stuff.  It is called https://www.xcodes.app

### Architecture

Some questions about architecture. There is some overhead to this solution but it puts you in a position to swap out the database implementation later.

  - https://github.com/joshuajhomann/DatabaseFacade

### Git Ignore

- Xcode puts stuff in .git/info/exlude
- John B. says https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Swift.gitignore

### Converting Objective-C code to Swift

### Wrapping PNG

Carlyn came up with a way to wrap LibPNG and all of its setjump/longjump error handling.

https://github.com/carlynorama/SwiftLIBPNG/blob/main/META.md

The source will run (eventually) on Linux. She demo'ed it this week.


### TimeKeep: Testing with @Dependency 

Last week we created a project timer. This week we wrote tests for it.

See https://github.com/rayfix/TimeKeep/tree/main/TimeKeep

```swift
import Dependencies
import XCTest

@testable import TimeKeep

final class TimeKeepTests: XCTestCase, @unchecked Sendable {

  var dateValue: Date = .now
  
  func testProjectTimer() {
    var generator = DateGenerator { self.dateValue }
    
    let timer = withDependencies {
      $0.date = generator
    } operation: {
      return ProjectTimer()
    }
    
    XCTAssertFalse(timer.isRunning)
    
    timer.start()
    XCTAssert(timer.isRunning)
        
    timer.stop()
    XCTAssertFalse(timer.isRunning)
    
    dateValue += 1
    
    XCTAssertEqual(timer.elapsed, .zero)
    
    timer.start()
    dateValue += 1
    XCTAssertEqual(timer.elapsed, .seconds(1))
    
    dateValue += 3
    XCTAssertEqual(timer.elapsed, .seconds(4))
    
    // A stopped timer should not record elapsed time.
    timer.stop()
    dateValue += 400
    XCTAssertEqual(timer.elapsed, .seconds(4))
  }
}
```

### Golden Ratio

Josh started with his project. He showed how you can overload operators in Swift to make beautiful syntax for defining golden ratio constants 1 Â± âˆš5

### Mixing SwiftUI and UIKit (Part II)

```swift
import Combine
import SwiftUI
import UIKit

import PlaygroundSupport
    
final class VM: ObservableObject {
    @Published var value = 0.0
}
    
final class VC: UIViewController {
    @ObservedObject var viewModel = VM()
    private var subscription: AnyCancellable?
    init() {
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        let label = UILabel()
        let vm = viewModel
        let button = UIButton(primaryAction: .init(image: .init(systemName: "arrow.counterclockwise"), handler: { _ n vm.value = 0.0 }))
        let slider = ViewBinding(\.value, on: vm) { $value in
            Slider(value: $value).frame(idealWidth: 300)
        }
        let stack = UIStackView(arrangedSubviews: [
            label,
            button,
            UIHostingController(rootView: slider).view
        ])
        stack.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        stack.axis = .vertical
        view?.addSubview(stack)
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerXAnchor),
            view.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerYAnchor)
        ])
        subscription = viewModel.$value
            .map(String.init(describing:)).map { $0 as String? }
            .assign(to: \.text, on: label)
    }

    @available(*, unavailable)
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
}
    
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(VC())
    
struct ViewBinding<Target: ObservableObject, Value, Content: View>: View {
    private let keypath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Target, Value>
    @ObservedObject private var target: Target
    private let content: (Binding<Value>) -> Content
    
    init(_ keypath: ReferenceWritableKeyPath<Target, Value>,
         on target: Target,
         @ViewBuilder content: @escaping (Binding<Value>) -> Content) {
            self.keypath = keypath
            _target = .init(wrappedValue: target)
            self.content = content
    }
    var body: some View {
        content($target[dynamicMember: keypath])
    }
}
```

This lets SwiftUI respond to changes from UIKit. The key difference is

```swift
let binding = Binding<Double>(get: { vm.value },
                          set: { vm.value = $0 })                          
let slider = Slider(value: binding).frame(idealWidth: 300)
```

versus:

```swift
let slider = ViewBinding(\.value, on: vm) { $value in
  Slider(value: $value).frame(idealWidth: 300)
}
```

### Discussions

- Ed was lamenting the state of HealthKit documentation. In particular, using workouts is not well documented at all.
- Activity tracking might be interesting.
- Property wrapper projected values $.  It can be used to create a binding or get to a publisher depending on where you put it.
- Be careful that you don't make your EnvironmentObjects too broad. Any view listening to it will need to rebuild for any change (more precisely when objectWillChange fires).


### The PNG Format

Carlyn is exploring the PNG format. She highly recommends the PNG book. Even though it is a little dated, it is extremely well written, informative, and funny.

- http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/book/


Her repos:

- https://github.com/carlynorama/SwiftLIBPNG


### Modern SwiftUI with sample app TimeKeep

Ray is starting a series to talk about modern SwiftUI heavily influenced by https://pointfree.co.  Together we are building a small app `TimeKeep` that lets you track time for multiple projects.

- Track the time for multiple projects simultaneously
- Multiplatform (iOS, macOS, etc)
- Highly testable
- Use modern architection

We started this week by building the basic domain and some helper extensions for dealing with
dates.

https://github.com/rayfix/TimeKeep/tree/main/TimeKeep

In the process we used point free library `Tagged` and `IdentifiedArrayOf` to model the domain as precisely as possible.

#### Meeting inspired changes

- Allen: Change the name of `Time` to `TimeEvent`.
- Ed: Use `Calendar` method to tell if two dates are the same day. 
- Josh: Use static member lookup instead of an enum for the filter predicate.

#### Next week

We will start putting up some UI.


### Mixing SwiftUI and UIKit

Josh gave a great example of how to integrate Swift with UIKit and some of the pitfalls associated with that.  The example demonstrates that using a Binding from UIKit to SwiftUI works but binding from SwiftUI to UIKit does not.  We will explore how to fix this next week.

```swift
import Combine
import SwiftUI
import UIKit
    
import PlaygroundSupport
    
final class VM {
    @Published var value = 0.0
}
    
final class VC: UIViewController {
    private let viewModel = VM()
    private var subscription: AnyCancellable?
    init() {
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        let label = UILabel()
        let vm = viewModel
        let button = UIButton(primaryAction: .init(image: .init(systemName: "arrow.counterclockwise"), handler: { _ in vm.value = 0.0 }))
        let stack = UIStackView(arrangedSubviews: [
            label,
            button,
            UIHostingController(rootView:
                Slider(value: Binding<Double>(get: { vm.value }, set: { vm.value = $0 })).frame(idealWidth: 300)
           ).view
        ])
        stack.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        stack.axis = .vertical
        view?.addSubview(stack)
        NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
            view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerXAnchor),
            view.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerYAnchor)
        ])
        subscription = viewModel.$value.map(String.init(describing:))
          .map { $0 as String? }.assign(to: \.text, on: label)
    }

    @available(*, unavailable)
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {
        fatalError("init(coder:) has not been implemented")
    }
}
    
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(VC())
```

### Swift One-liners

Franklin brought to our attention that Swift can now be invoked with -e on the command line.

- https://blog.eidinger.info/swift-e-runs-code-directly-from-the-command-line

### What's New In Swift 5.8

Josh gave us a tour of what is available in Swift 5.8.

- https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/256/whats-new-in-swift-5-8

### Morphology in Foundation

Ray reminded us that you can say, `Text("\^[(count) items](inflect: true)")` and 
items will be pluralized properly. It works for other languages too.

- https://medium.com/geekculture/automatic-grammar-agreement-b953cbf5d101

### Flocking Simulation (Boids)

Josh started a presentation on implementing flocking using Timeline/Canvas in SwiftUI. Some background material:

- http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1987/SIGGRAPH87.pdf
- http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.html
- https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html

His implementation used an unsafe to hold the `Boid` type to prevent reference count traffic. You can learn about that here:

### TikTok Logo Effect: Metal Shaders in CoreImage

Josh began creating a sample App that lets you pick an image from your library
and apply a color separating effect (think TikTok logo) on the image.
This week he showed the main points:

- Create a metal file
- Add special flag -fcikernel to Other Metal Compiler Flags and Other Metal Linker Flags
- Make the function extern "C" so metal can see it.

```swift
#include <metal_stdlib>
#include <CoreImage/CoreImage.h>
using namespace metal;

extern "C" {
    auto channelOffset(coreimage::sampler s, float2 redOffset, float2 greenOffset, float2 blueOffset) -> float4 {
        auto index = s.coord();
        return float4(
            s.sample(index - redOffset).r,
            s.sample(index - greenOffset).g,
            s.sample(index - blueOffset).b,
            s.sample(index).a
        );
    }
}
```

Using the `-` to subract the offsets is arbitrary. (It could have been `+` too.)

New actor proposal

Frank's code for his talk about distributed actors:
https://github.com/franklefebvre/DistributedActors-FrenchKit

Question from Allen: how to we sync state between SwiftUI and Scenekit
- Answer: have a single source of truth:
```swift
    final class ViewModel: ObsevableObject {
        @Published var truth
    ...
    }
```
- share with SwiftUI with binding via the projected value of the `StateObject`:
```
   childview($viewmodel.binding)
```
- share with SceneKit with a publisher projected fromt he `@Published` property
```
   scene(viewmodel.$truth)
```

### WeightedStackView


Josh put together a new type of stack layout that lets each view communicate what weight it wants to the layout system. He wrote the logic for placing views in a functional style and utilized lazy sequences to avoid creation of temporary copies.

See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/lazysequenceprotocol


```swift
import PlaygroundSupport
import SwiftUI

struct V: View {
    var body: some View {
        WeightedStackLayout(axis: .vertical, spacing: 0) {
            Color.red.stack(weight: 7)
            Color.green.stack(weight: 5)
            Text("hi").background(Color.yellow)
            Color.blue.stack(weight: 3)
            Color.orange.stack(weight: 2)
            Color.brown.stack(weight: 4)
            Color.cyan.stack(weight: 3)
        }
            .frame(width: 400, height: 400)
    }
}

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(V())

struct WeightedStackLayoutKey: LayoutValueKey {
    static var defaultValue = 1.0
}

extension View {
    func stack(weight: Double) -> some View {
        layoutValue(key: WeightedStackLayoutKey.self, value: weight)
    }
}

extension Layout.Subviews.Element {
    var stackWeight: Double {
        max(self[WeightedStackLayoutKey.self], 1e-6)
    }
}

struct WeightedStackLayout: Layout {
    var axis: Axis = .vertical
    var spacing: CGFloat = 10

    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) -> CGSize {
        proposal.replacingUnspecifiedDimensions(by: .zero)
    }

    func placeSubviews(in bounds: CGRect, proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) {
        let totalSpace = CGFloat(subviews.count - 1) * spacing
        let dimension = (axis == .vertical ? bounds.height : bounds.width) - totalSpace
        let pointsPerWeight = dimension / subviews.lazy.map(\.stackWeight).reduce(0, +)
        let weights = subviews.lazy.map(\.stackWeight).accumulated(0, +)
        let points = zip(
            weights.dropLast(),
            weights.dropFirst()
        ).enumerated().lazy.map { offset, element in
            let (startWeight, endWeight) = element
            let spaceBefore = spacing * CGFloat(offset)
            let offset = axis == .vertical ? bounds.origin.y : bounds.origin.x
            return (
                start: startWeight * pointsPerWeight + spaceBefore + offset,
                end: endWeight * pointsPerWeight + spaceBefore + offset
            )
        }
        zip(subviews, points).forEach { view, point in
            let distance = point.end - point.start
            switch axis {
            case .vertical:
                view.place(
                    at: .init(x: bounds.midX, y: point.start + distance / 2),
                    anchor: .center,
                    proposal: .init(width: bounds.width, height: distance)
                )
            case .horizontal:
                view.place(
                    at: .init(x: point.start + distance / 2, y: bounds.midY),
                    anchor: .center,
                    proposal: .init(width: distance, height: bounds.height)
                )
            }
        }
    }

}

struct LazyAccumulatedSequence<Accumulated>: LazySequenceProtocol {
    private let _makeIterator: () -> Iterator
    init<Element>(
        underlying: some Sequence<Element>,
        initial: Accumulated,
        accumulate: @escaping (Accumulated, Element) -> Accumulated

        var current = initial
        var accumulated = [Accumulated]()
        accumulated.reserveCapacity(underestimatedCount + 1)
        accumulated.append(current)
        for element in self {

### Unicode

Swift Strings are unique in the way that they handle Unicode. Several examples from Josh about how mutation is handled with both `String` and bridged `NSString` and `NSMutableString`. Swift makes a defensive copy for you when assigning.

```swift
var a: String = "a"
var b: UnsafeMutablePointer<String> = .init(&a)
a = "b"
print(a,b.pointee)

var c: NSMutableString = "c"
var d: NSString = c
c = "d"
print(c,d)

@propertyWrapper
struct Reference<Value> {
    final class Wrapper<Value> {
        var value: Value
        init(value: Value) {
            self.value = value
        }
    }
    private var wrapper: Wrapper<Value>
    var wrappedValue: Value {
        get { wrapper.value }
        set { wrapper.value = newValue }
    }
    init(wrappedValue: Value) {
        wrapper = .init(value: wrappedValue)
    }
}

var e = Reference(wrappedValue: "e")
var f = e
e.wrappedValue = "f"
print(e.wrappedValue, f.wrappedValue)

["Ã¢a", "Ã¡b", "Ã c", "ad", "Ã¤e"].lazy.map { string in
    string.contains("a")
}.forEach { print($0) }

["Ã¢a", "z", "Ã¡b", "Ã c", "ad", "Ã¤e"].sorted { lhs, rhs in
    lhs.lexicographicallyPrecedes(rhs)
}.forEach { print($0) }

["Ã¢a", "Ã¡b", "Ã c", "ad", "Ã¤e"].lazy.map { string in
    string.localizedStandardContains("a")
}.forEach { print($0) }

["Ã¢a", "z", "Ã¡b", "Ã c", "ad", "Ã¤e"].sorted { lhs, rhs in
    lhs.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare(rhs) == .orderedAscending
}.forEach { print($0) }
```

### AsyncImage Fix

Jake had an update to how he was able to fix the animation problem with `AsyncImage`. Here is the code:

```swift
AsyncImage(url: user.profileURL,
           transaction: Transaction(animation: .default)) { phase in
  switch phase {
    case .success(let image):
             image.resizable()
                  .clipShape(Circle())
                  .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
    default:
            ZStack {
              Circle().stroke(.black)
                      .frame(width: 90, height: 90)
              Image(systemName: "person")
                      .font(.title.bold())
                      .scaledToFill()
            }
    }                                  
}.frame(width: 90, height: 90)
```

### Non-uniform shuffling

Carlyn asked about the most Swifty way to enable non-uniform probability picking.

Some suggestions from the group:

- Look around in GameKit? (Perhaps look at this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXnuMk7AVwc)
- Create an array with duplicates of the number of elements in the probablilty you want.
- Create a special collection that vends the duplicates without actually hosting them in memory.

### Speeding up Conformance Checking

We reviewed this blog post about how you can re-order conformance records to get a 20% performance boost.

-  https://www.emergetools.com/blog/posts/how-order-files-speed-up-protocols


### Wurdle (Wordle Clone)

Josh continued his epic presentation on a Wordle clone.  Attempted to make it work pretty. Namely, `GeometryReader` is not greedy and anchors things to the upper-left. You can work around it by adding a ZStack that contains a greedy view like Color.clear or Rectangle().hidden() to the ZStack.

We used the `Layout` protocol which is a type of view that can explicitly control the layout of a view and its subviews. Josh created a AnchorInParentLayout that lets you align an arbitrary position (`UnitPoint`) with an arbitrary position of the subview(s). A view modifier makes it easy to use.

## 2023.01.21


### Layout with AsyncImage

Jake was seeing a problem with `AsyncImage` where the transition animation would be cancelled when the async image loaded.  The image would appear at the destination without loading. Josh theorized that the problem was happening because its identity was changing. However, we could not seem to fix the problem by explicitly setting `id` on the views.

One recommendation is to use a much more capable third party library like Nuke.

- https://github.com/kean/Nuke


### Dates

Using Core Data to sort by date. Ed says, "`CalendarComponents` is your friend."  Trevor recommended this resource:  https://nsdateformatter.com/

### Inspiration for UI

- Edward Tufte

Jacey noted that SnapKit is also good (easy) way to layout views.

- https://github.com/SnapKit/SnapKit


### Sendable

Sendable conformance will be one of the important areas to be aware of as come into Swift 6. You can enable strict concurrency warnings in your build settings. The default is minimal but you can use "targetted" to check your own code.

When you enabled this checking, you will see warnings where an instance is passed across a concurrency domain and is not `Sendable`. For example:

```swift
func findInBackground(quadTree: QuadTree,
                      region: CGRect) async -> Task<[CGPoint], Never> {
  Task.detached {
    quadTree.find(in: region) // WARNING: QuadTree is not Sendable
  }
}
```

You can mark `QuadTree` as `Sendable` to fix this warning. This will, in turn, lead to a warning that `Node`, the reference type, is not sendable. If you mark `Node` sendable you get more warnings. This is because the class contains multiple immutable stored properties that could get modified from another concurrency domain. In this case you can mark `Node` with `@unchecked Sendable` since you know that all mutation is protected by `isKnownUniquelyReferenced` and makes a deep copy if it is not unique. (Aka COW.) 


### Benchmarks

The collection-benchmark project allows you to create benchmarks where the time might be dependent on the size of the input.  We created a command-line target and included the benchmark package.

- https://github.com/apple/swift-collections-benchmark


We wrote the following benchmarks:

```swift
import CollectionsBenchmark
import CoreGraphics.CGBase

struct TestPoints {
  let region: CGRect
  let points: [CGPoint]
  
  init(size: Int) {
    region = CGRect(origin: .zero, size: CGSize(width: size, height: size))
    points = zip((0..<size).shuffled(), (0..<size).shuffled())
      .map { CGPoint(x: $0.0, y: $0.1) }
  }
}


var benchmark = Benchmark(title: "QuadTree Benchmarks")

benchmark.registerInputGenerator(for: TestPoints.self) { size in
  TestPoints(size: size)
}


benchmark.add(title: "QuadTree find",
              input: TestPoints.self) { testPoints in
  
  let tree = QuadTree(region: testPoints.region, points: testPoints.points)
  return { timer in
    testPoints.points.forEach { point in
          let searchRegion = CGRect(origin: point, size: .zero).insetBy(dx: -1, dy: -1)
          blackHole(tree.find(in: searchRegion))
        }
  }
}

benchmark.addSimple(title: "Array<CGPoint> filter",
                    input: TestPoints.self) { testPoints in
  testPoints.points.forEach { point in
    let searchRegion =  CGRect(origin: point, size: .zero).insetBy(dx: -1, dy: -1)
    blackHole(testPoints.points.filter { candidate in
      searchRegion.contains(candidate)
    })
  }
}

benchmark.main()
```

Then we ran the following commands arguments:

```
run QuadFindResult.json --cycles 1
render QuadFindResults.json QuadFindResults.png
```

This produced the following results:

![Benchmark Results for Find](materials/QuadFindResults.png)

This is a log-log chart and you can see that the growth of the array implementation is linear.

You can see the jump at 4 items which is where the QuadTree logic is kicking in.  I found that on my machine, I can boost this constant to 512 to make it always perform better than array.

You can also use a special group file to automatically produce sets of benchmarks and multiple graphs.

### Wurdle

Josh continued working on the Wordle game example getting through a lot of the layout issues of the words and keyboard (adding return and backspace).

### PointFree Dependency Injection

A new library for dependency injection was announced this week by the folks at pointfree.co. Josh gave us a quick tour of the library and an additions library:

https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies

Peter posted this example of using the additions library:

https://twitter.com/tgrapperon/status/1612698675356250114

### Ed Launches Testflight

Ed launched a private testfligt build for his new app. During the coarse of the meeting was able to find and fix an out of bounds crasher when there is no data. The power of testing in action.

### Learning Swift

Some of the tried and true:

- https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu
- https://twostraws.gumroad.com/l/pro-swiftui

### Async Result

You can create an async init for result types to get clean monadic chaining instead of nested `do {} catch {}` blocks. Daniel and Josh showed us how!


### CoreData

Core Data is a deep subject. A good place to start:

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coredata/setting_up_a_core_data_stack



### Noise Generation

GameKit although old and written in ObjectiveC, has API for creating "natural" noise often used for procedural terrain generation in games. 

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/gameplaykit/gknoisemap


### Wurdle

As part of another epic, multipart demo, Josh is implementing a version of the popular game in SwiftUI.  Today he created the basic model for Rows and Letters and Keys as well as the Status for each.

### Using contraMap Example

You can write a contramap function on `CurrentValueSubject<Int>` to make functions
that can send other types into the current value.

```swift
import Foundation
import Combine

extension CurrentValueSubject {
    func contraMap<Value>(transform: @escaping (Value) -> Output) -> (Value) -> Void {
      { [weak self] input in
          self?.send(transform(input))
      }
    }
}

let subject = CurrentValueSubject<Int, Never>(0)
let sendBool = subject.contraMap { (bool: Bool) in bool ? 1 : 0 }
sendBool(true)
print(subject.value)
```

### Learning SwiftUI

- https://swiftui-lab.com
- https://swiftui-lab.com/companion/


### Core Data Debugging

Suggestions for Dan's app that has a crashing problem:

- Log non-fatal errors
- Think about all of the validations done by the Core Data model
- It reliably crashes on start
- Take note of the OS / devices it is happening on in the crash logs
- Debugging concurrency issues with -com.apple.CoreData.ConcurrencyDebug 1

### Returning Swift Conferences

- https://deepdishswift.com
- https://www.swiftconf.to
- https://tryswift.jp (meetup style on 1/21)

### Swift Charts Performance

Ed wrote his own charts with `GeometryReader` instead of SwiftUI Charts because of
performance problems on rotation and scrolling.

### Photo Picker iOS16

- Jake reports it is awesome.
- Requires user iteraction so no permission is required.
- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/photospicker


### New Swift Proposals

https://www.swift.org/swift-evolution/

- SE-0383 Deprecate @UIApplicationMain and @NSApplicationMain
- SE-0384 Importing Forward Declared Objective-C Interfaces and Protocols
- SE-0382 Expression Macros

### Compression
The new multicore APFS aware Apple Archive framework: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applearchive

### Swift Collections

Josh took us on a guided tour of the Swift Collections package.

- https://github.com/apple/swift-collections

Exploration of CHAMP:
- https://blog.acolyer.org/2015/11/27/hamt/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imrSQ82dYns


Aside: A Benchmarking Tool

### JSON with decode indirect enum


You can represent JSON with swift with this:

```swift
enum JSON {
	indirect case array([JSON])
	indirect case dictionary([String: JSON])
	case boolean(Bool)
	case number(Double)
	case string(String)
	case null
}
```

You can implement `Decodable` using a single value container. Naively it is a bunch of nested `do {} catch {}` blocks but it can be done quite succinctly by using a `Result` type and `flatMapError` to implement successive retries.

```swift
enum JSON {
    indirect case array([JSON])
    indirect case dictionary([String: JSON])
    case boolean(Bool)
    case number(Double)
    case string(String)
    case null
}

extension JSON: Decodable {
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        self = try Result { try decoder.singleValueContainer() }
            .flatMap { container in
                container.decodeNil()
                    ? .success(JSON.null)
                    : Result { JSON.boolean(try container.decode(Bool.self)) }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.number(try container.decode(Double.self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.string(try container.decode(String.self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.array(try container.decode([JSON].self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.dictionary(try container.decode([String: JSON].self)) } }
            }.get()
    }
}
```
