### Concurrency in Legacy Code

Questions from Rainer about how to use concurrency effectively in legacy code.

We talked about where things run and how the default might change in future versions
of Swift.


Link from Peter:

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor/assertisolated(_:file:line:)

Examples from Josh:

```swift
struct A {
    //@MainActor
    nonisolated func a() {
        Task {
            MainActor.assertIsolated()
        }
    }
}

Task {
     A().a()
}


```

Instead of falling back to using Combine (which bring tech debt with it), a suggestion from Josh to make
simple abstractions to avoid creating Tasks everywhere.

    
```swift
extension AsyncSequence where Failure == Never {
    func subscribe<Unretained: AnyObject>(withUnretained object: Unretained, onNext: @escaping (Unretained, Element) -> Void) -> Task<Void, Never> {
        Task { [weak object] in
            for await value in self {
                guard let object else { return }
                onNext(object, value)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Can be used like this:

```swift
actor A {
    var subscription: Task<Void, Never>?
     func a()  {
         let (output, input) = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: Int.self, bufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(1))
         subscription = output.subscribe(withUnretained: self) { unretained, value in
             print(unretained, value)    
         }
         input.yield(1)
         input.yield(2)
         input.yield(3)
    }
}
```

### File System

This came up in the context of Peter's custom image caching problem.

Some notes from Carlyn:

Using custom executors (Josh)

- https://www.swift.org/migration/documentation/swift-6-concurrency-migration-guide/incrementaladoption
    

```swift
actor LandingSite {
    private let queue = DispatchSerialQueue(label: "something")

    nonisolated var unownedExecutor: UnownedSerialExecutor {
        queue.asUnownedSerialExecutor()
    }
    
    func acceptTransport(_ transport: PersonalTransportation) {
        // this function will be running on queue
    }
}
```
    
10:35:09 From carlyn to Everyone:
    private func appendData(data: Data) throws {
        let fileHandle = try FileHandle(forWritingTo: storageUrl)
        fileHandle.seekToEndOfFile()
        fileHandle.write(data)
        fileHandle.closeFile()
      }

Creating a custom global actor:

```swift
@globalActor actor SharedActor {
  static let shared = SharedActor()
}
    
@SharedActor final class A { }
@SharedActor final class B { }
```

### Delphi Style Components

Starting with Package definitions. From MJ

```swift
// Dependency grouping
enum Dependencies {
    static var common: [Target.Dependency] {
        [
            .product(name: "Difference", package: "Difference"),
            .product(name: "LifetimeTracker", package: "LifetimeTracker"),
        ]
    }
}

    .target(
         name: "SharedModels",
         dependencies:
            Dependencies.common + [
                "AutomaticSettings",
            ]
    ),
```    

These ideas come from:

### SwiftUI View Builders


View builder returns some View which is a container view like `ConditionalContent`.

```swift    
struct W: View {
    let a: Int
    @ViewBuilder
    var body: some View {
        switch a {
        case ..<0: Text("Negative")
        case 0: Text("Zero")
        case 1... : Color.green
        default: EmptyView()
      }
    }
}
```
    

### SwiftUI Navigation Bug

Joe shared this SwiftUI navigation bug:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            NavigationLink {
                Text("Do not tap back, you'll regret it")
                    .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)
                    .toolbarBackground(Color.orange, for: .navigationBar)
                    .toolbarColorScheme(.dark, for: .navigationBar)
            } label: {
                VStack {
                    Text("First page is the sweetest")
                }               
                .padding()
            }
            .navigationTitle("First Page")
            .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)
            .toolbarBackground(Color.orange, for: .navigationBar)
            .toolbarColorScheme(.dark, for: .navigationBar)
        }
    }
}
```

### Sequencing Animations    
    

Sample from Josh:

```swift
    withAnimation(animation, completionCriteria: .logicallyComplete) {
                operation()
            } completion: {
                continuation.resume()
            }
```

### Hacking Problem
    

Puzzle from John Brewer

```swift
var test3 = [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -9, -6, 10, 1, -5]
print(largestSumSpan(array: test3)) // [10, 1]
var test4 = [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -9, -6, 8, 1, -5]
print(largestSumSpan(array: test4)) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
What is the best idiomatic Swift to handle this?

```swift    
print(missingPair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))
9
```

There is a "trick" to this one which to xor all of the bits.

### Resources and SwiftPM

- Peter was able to make a common target that other targets could depend on.

Exciting announcement Carlyn let us know about is that Swift Build (used by Xcode)
is, as of today, an open source technology. It will support Windows and Linux.

- https://forums.swift.org/t/evolving-swiftpm-builds-with-swift-build/77596/2

Also, the official announcement:

https://www.swift.org/blog/the-next-chapter-in-swift-build-technologies/

We looked at conditional package inclusion. You can conditionalize based on
platform but it doesn't look like there are too many other options.

An example from Mihaela:

```swift
    .product(name: "ResChatHouUIKit", package: "ResChatHouUIKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.iOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatUIKit", package: "ResChatUIKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.iOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatHouAppKit", package: "ResChatHouAppKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.macOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatAppKitUI", package: "ResChatAppKitUI", condition: .when(platforms: [.macOS])),
                    ]
            ),
```

### Swift Playgrounds App

Now supports Swift 6.  You may need to remove previous versions.

### Hex Tac Toe

Ed is working on his game hex-tac-toe.  Lots of suggestions for how to improve.


### Other random stuff

It is an open source airdrop thing but written in Flutter:

### Making CoW Types Sendable

We modernized a small app to Swift 6. Making a type CoW and isolating all mutation
allows you to declare a type sendable. The mutable state is not shared so these 
properties can be marked sendable (unsafe).

### Performance

### Animating Text

Rainer was trying to animate text along a BÃ©zier curve.

Josh reminded us of this project example from last year:

### Continuing the Mine Sweeper Example

This week we looked at a serious performance problem in what we built so far.
Changing the color of a handful of tile taking almost a second to perform.

A nice video from Ben Cohen about Fast Safe Mutable State:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXJIIQ-B4-E
    

An internal way to do in-place mutation:

- https://jano.dev/apple/2024/12/10/Modify-and-Yield.html
- https://forums.swift.org/t/modify-accessors/31872
    

But the biggest performance win was had by using a properly identifiable type in the ForEach statement of the grid.

### A functional solution to Ed's game
  * Ed is making a game where he needs to match n distinct items in a row.  Josh offered a solution in functional swift:
  * We start with an assumption that we have a node, a sequence of adjacencies that can transform a node into another node, and the number of distinct items we want to match
```swift
let n = 6
let adjacency: some Sequence<(Node) -> Node?>
let node: Node
```
![layout](materials/blocks.png)
  * We can express the algorithm we want to apply as a node represents a winning state if there is a way to transform it into a sequence of n distinct elements. or more formally:
![layout](materials/existential.png)
  * Equivalently in swift:
```swift
let isWon = adjacency.contains { [node, n] adjacency in
	Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))).count == n
}
```
  * We can further express our intent with the use of explanatory variables:
```swift
let isWon = adjacency.contains { [node, n] adjacency in
    let adjacentUnique = Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))
	let isWinningRun = adjacentUnique.count == n
	return isWinningRun
}
```
* Ed asked how to get the winning nodes.  We can do this by changing the operator to `compactMap`:
```swift
let winningSets = adjacency.compactMap { [node, n] adjacency in
    let adjacentUnique = Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))
	let isWinningRun = adjacentUnique.count == n
	return isWinningRun ? adjacentUnique : nil
}
.reduce(into: Set<Node>()) { $0.formUnion($1) }
```

### Mine sweeper continued
* We updated the Layout to use a cache and added a viewModel:
```swift
@Observable
final class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private(set) var cells: Grid2D<Cell> = .init(rows: 8, columns: 8) { x, y in
        .init(id: x + y * 8, position: .init(x, y), color: .allCases.randomElement()!)
    }
    func tap(index: SIMD2<Int>) {
        cells[index].color = .blue
    }
}

struct Cell: Identifiable, Hashable {
    let id: Int
    let position: SIMD2<Int>
    var color: ViewModel.BoardColor
}

extension ViewModel {
    enum BoardColor: Hashable, CaseIterable {
        case red, green, blue
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
    var body: some View {
        Board(dimension: 8) {
            ForEach(viewModel.cells.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                Group {
                    switch viewModel.cells[index].color {
                    case .red: Color.red
                    case .green: Color.green
                    case .blue: Color.blue
                    }
                }
                .onTapGesture {
                    viewModel.tap(index:  viewModel.cells[index].position)
                }
                .boardPosition(index)
            }
        }
    }
}

extension View {
    func boardPosition(_ position: SIMD2<Int>) -> some View {
        layoutValue(key: BoardPosition.self, value: position)
    }
    func boardPosition(x: Int, y: Int) -> some View {
        boardPosition(.init(x, y))
    }
}

struct Board: Layout {
    let dimension: Int

    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout Cache) -> CGSize {
        let size = proposal.replacingUnspecifiedDimensions(by: .zero)
        let minimumDimension = min(size.width, size.height)
        return .init(width: minimumDimension, height: minimumDimension)
    }

    func placeSubviews(in bounds: CGRect, proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout Cache) {
        if cache.bounds != bounds {
            cache.bounds = bounds
            cache.cellSize = CGSize(width: bounds.width / Double(dimension), height: bounds.height / Double(dimension))
            let transform = CGAffineTransform
                .identity
                .translatedBy(x: bounds.origin.x, y: bounds.origin.y)
                .scaledBy(x: cache.cellSize.width, y: cache.cellSize.height)
            cache.grid = .init(rows: dimension, columns: dimension) { x, y in
                CGPoint(x: x, y: y).applying(transform)
            }
        }
        for view in subviews {
            let position = cache.grid[safe: view[BoardPosition.self]] ?? bounds.origin
            view.place(
                at: position,
                proposal: .init(cache.cellSize)
            )
        }
    }

    func makeCache(subviews: Subviews) -> Cache {
        .init()
    }

    struct Cache {
        var bounds = CGRect.zero
        var cellSize = CGSize.zero
        var grid: Grid2D<CGPoint> = .init(repeating: .zero, rows: 0, columns: 0)
    }
}

struct BoardPosition: LayoutValueKey {
    static let defaultValue = SIMD2<Int>.zero
}
```
