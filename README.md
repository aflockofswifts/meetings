        let scaleVector = powerSeries * Self.matrix
        let xProduct = scaleVector * x

## 2024.05.11

We looked at the transform matching parts animation in [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/reference/manim.animation.transform_matching_parts.TransformMatchingShapes.html)  
We started recreating this by making a Bezier Curve.  First a [quadratic](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mbgwndpeeh):
```swift
struct QuadraticBezierCurve {
    typealias Point = SIMD2<Double>
    typealias Vector = SIMD3<Double>
    typealias Matrix = matrix_double3x3
    private let x: Vector
    private let y: Vector
    static let matrix = Matrix(rows: [
        .init(1, -2,  1),
        .init(0,  2, -2),
        .init(0,  0,  1)
    ])
    init(start: Point, control: Point, end: Point) {
        x = Vector(start.x, control.x, end.x)
        y = Vector(start.y, control.y, end.y)
    }
    init(start: CGPoint, control: CGPoint, end: CGPoint) {
        x = Vector(start.x, control.x, end.x)
        y = Vector(start.y, control.y, end.y)
    }
    func callAsFunction(_ t: Double) -> Point {
        let powerSeries = Vector(1, t, t*t)
        let scaleVector = Self.matrix * powerSeries
        let xProduct = scaleVector * x
        let yProduct = scaleVector * y
        return Point(xProduct.sum(), yProduct.sum())
    }
    func cgPoint(at t: Double) -> CGPoint {
        let point = self(t)
        return .init(x: point.x, y: point.y)
    }
}
```

and then a [Cubic](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ebdtbxgbq0):
```swift
struct CubicBezierCurve {
    typealias Point = SIMD2<Double>
    typealias Vector = SIMD4<Double>
    typealias Matrix = matrix_double4x4
    private let x: Vector
    private let y: Vector
    static let matrix = Matrix([
        .init(1, -3,  3, -1),
        .init(0,  3, -6,  3),
        .init(0,  0,  3, -3),
        .init(0,  0,  0,  1)
    ])
    init(start: Point, control1: Point, control2: Point, end: Point) {
        x = Vector(start.x, control1.x, control2.x, end.x)
        y = Vector(start.y, control1.y, control2.y, end.y)
    }
    init(start: CGPoint, control1: CGPoint, control2: CGPoint, end: CGPoint) {
        x = Vector(start.x, control1.x, control2.x, end.x)
        y = Vector(start.y, control1.y, control2.y, end.y)
    }
    func callAsFunction(_ t: Double) -> Point {
        let powerSeries = Vector(1, t, t*t, t*t*t)
        let scaleVector =  powerSeries * Self.matrix
        let xProduct = scaleVector * x
        let yProduct = scaleVector * y
        return Point(xProduct.sum(), yProduct.sum())
    }
    func cgPoint(at t: Double) -> CGPoint {
        let point = self(t)
        return .init(x: point.x, y: point.y)
    }
}
```

then demonstrating that we can trace the same path as SwiftUI and use that path to drive an animation position:
```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        GeometryReader { proxy in
            let size = proxy.size
            let points: [CGPoint] = [
                .init(x: 0, y: size.height),
                .init(x: 0, y: size.height * 0.33),
                .init(x: size.width, y: size.height * 0.33),
                .init(x: size.width, y: size.height),
            ]
            let cubic = CubicBezierCurve(start: points[0], control1: points[1], control2: points[2], end: points[3])
            Canvas { context, size in
                let path = Path { path in
                    path.move(to: points[0])
                    path.addCurve(to: points[3], control1: points[1], control2: points[2])
                }
                context.stroke(path, with: .foreground, style: .init(lineWidth: 2))
                stride(from: 0.0, through: 1.0, by: 0.1).forEach { t in
                    let center = cubic.cgPoint(at: t)
                    context.fill(Path { path in
                        path.addArc(center: center, radius: 10, startAngle: .zero, endAngle: .radians(.pi * 2), clockwise: true)
                    }, with: .color(.red))
                }
            }
            TimelineView(.animation) { timeline in
                Canvas { context, size in
                    let t = fmod(timeline.date.timeIntervalSince(.distantPast), 5) / 5
                    let center = cubic.cgPoint(at: t)
                    context.fill(Path { path in
                        path.addArc(center: center, radius: 10, startAngle: .zero, endAngle: .radians(.pi * 2), clockwise: true)
                    }, with: .color(.green))
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Topics Discussed

- Dependency injection how and why.  
Monty asked about making his dates and times testable:
```swift
import Foundation

protocol SystemServiceProtocol {
    var now: Date { get }
}

final class SystemService: SystemServiceProtocol {
    var now: Date {
        .now
    }
}

final class MockSystemService: SystemServiceProtocol {
    var now: Date = .distantPast
}
```
We also discussed remote configuration and making a debug menu and debugService

- Swift Evolution: Synchronous Mutex Exclusion Lock

    - https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0433-mutex.md
Mark asked about making the lock checkable.  We discussed adding a wrapper to to this:
```swift
@dynamicMemberLookup
struct Flagged<Wrapped> {
    var isLocked: Bool
    var wrapped: Wrapped
    subscript<Value>(dynamicMember dynamicMember: WritableKeyPath<Self, Value>) -> Value {
        self[dynamicMember: dynamicMember]
    }
}
```

- Solving coding challenges with idiomatic Swift
    - https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions
    - https://github.com/apple/swift-collections
    - https://github.com/apple/swift-algorithms

```swift
func two(sum target: Int, from values: [Int]) -> (Int, Int)? {
    let lookup = values.enumerated().reduce(into: [Int: [Int]]()) { accumulated, next in
        accumulated[next.element, default: []].append(next.element)
    }
    return values.print().enumerated().lazy.compactMap { (index, value) -> (Int, Int)? in
        guard let other = lookup[target - value], let otherIndex = other.last, otherIndex != index else { return nil }
        return (index, otherIndex)
    }
    .first
}
```

Peter asked about a print for Sequence mirroring Combine's print operator.  We looked at the general form:
```swift
extension Sequence {
    func sideEffect(_ effect: (Element) -> Void) -> some Sequence<Element> {
        map { value in
            effect(value)
            return value
        }
    }
}
```
and the specific solution:
```swift
extension Sequence where Element: CustomStringConvertible {
    func print() -> some Sequence<Element> {
        sideEffect { Swift.print(String(describing: $0)) }
    }
}
```

### Presentation: Maps and SwiftUI

Frank showed us how to implement a map today in SwiftUI. His implementation let us put down points of interest with a long tap in pure SwiftUI.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import MapKit
  
struct POI: Identifiable {
  let id = UUID().uuidString
  var location: CLLocationCoordinate2D
      
  init(coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) {
    location = coordinate
  }
      
  init(latitude: CLLocationDegrees, longitude: CLLocationDegrees) {
    location = .init(latitude: latitude, longitude: longitude)
  }
}

struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var points: [POI] = [
          .init(latitude: 48.85, longitude: 2.33),
          .init(latitude: 48.87, longitude: 2.38)
      ]
      
  var body: some View {
      MapReader { mapProxy in
          Map {
            ForEach(points) { point in
                Marker(coordinate: point.location) {
                    Image(systemName: "globe")
                }
            }
          }.onLongPressGestureWithLocation { point in
            if let coordinate = mapProxy.convert(point, from: .local) {
                  points.append(.init(coordinate: coordinate))
            }
        }
    }
  }
}

struct LongPressGestureWithLocation: ViewModifier {
  private var perform: (CGPoint) -> Void
  @State private var location: CGPoint?
      
  init(perform: @escaping (CGPoint) -> Void) {
    self.perform = perform
  }
      
  @ViewBuilder
  func body(content: Content) -> some View {
    content
      .gesture(DragGesture(minimumDistance: 0)
      .onChanged { value in
          location = value.location
      }
      .simultaneously(with: LongPressGesture()
      .onEnded { done in
          if done, let location {
            perform(location)
          }
        })
      )
    }
  }
  
extension View {
  func onLongPressGestureWithLocation(perform: @escaping (CGPoint) -> Void) -> some View {
    modifier(LongPressGestureWithLocation(perform: perform))
  }
}
```

#### Fixing up Geometry Reader

As a bonus side-topic, Josh showed how to "fix" how layout of a geometry reader works.

```swift
var body some View {
  let _ = Self._printChanges()
  GeometryReader { geometry in
    VStack {
      Image (systemName: "globe")
        .imageScale(.large)
      Text ("Hello, world!")
        .padding()
    }
    .frame(
        width: geometry.size.width, 
        height: geometry.size.height, 
        alignment: .center)
    }
}
```

Here is the code for the inspector:


```swift
struct InspectorLayout: Layout {
    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) -> CGSize {
        let size = subviews.first?.sizeThatFits(proposal) ?? .zero
        print(
        """
        \(subviews.first?[LayoutNameKey.self] ?? ""):
        Received proposal: width \(proposal.width.proposalDescription) height: \(proposal.height.proposalDescription)
        Returning \(size)
        """
        )
        return size
    }

    func placeSubviews(in bounds: CGRect, proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout ()) {
        subviews.forEach {
            print("placing \(subviews.first?[LayoutNameKey.self] ?? ""): width: \(proposal.width.proposalDescription) height: \(proposal.height.proposalDescription)")
            $0.place(at: .init(x: bounds.midX, y: bounds.midY), anchor: .center, proposal: proposal)
        }
    }
}


private struct LayoutNameKey: LayoutValueKey {
    static let defaultValue = "[unnamed view]"
}

extension View {
    func inspectLayout(name: some CustomStringConvertible) -> some View {
        InspectorLayout() {
            layoutValue(key: LayoutNameKey.self, value: String(describing: name))
        }
    }
}

private extension Optional where Wrapped == CGFloat {
    var proposalDescription: String {
        map {
            switch $0 {
            case .infinity: "max"
            case .zero: "min"
            default: "custom \(self!)"
            }
        } ?? "ideal"

#### Async From a Low Level

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_K-us4-K7s

## 2024.04.06

### Presentation: Ordering Async Work

Josh showed us an outline for a solution to order async work. It uses an actor to organize (and protect) a list of prioritized sendable closures that it can execute using a discardable task group. It uses the `Heap` structure from Swift Collection to establish the work order and an async stream to feed in and process work.

- https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/blob/main/Documentation/Heap.md

```swift
import Foundation
import HeapModule

actor AsyncPriorityWorkQueue<Priority: Comparable & Sendable, Output> {
    private let maxConcurrentElements: Int
    private let postWorkNotification: AsyncStream<Void>.Continuation
    private var concurrentItems = 0
    private var subscriptions = Subscriptions()
    private var priorityQueue = Heap<Work>()
    init(of output: Output.Type, priorityOfType: Priority.Type = Int.self, maxConcurrentElements: Int) {
        self.maxConcurrentElements = maxConcurrentElements
        let (workNotifications, postWorkNotification) = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: Void.self, bufferingPolicy: .unbounded)
        self.postWorkNotification = postWorkNotification
        subscriptions += Task {
            await withDiscardingTaskGroup { [weak self] group in
                for await _ in workNotifications {
                    while let work = await self?.dequeueWork() {
                        group.addTask {
                            await work.operation()
                            postWorkNotification.yield()
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    private func dequeueWork() -> Work? {
        concurrentItems < maxConcurrentElements
            ? priorityQueue.popMax()
            : nil
    }
    private func enqueue(priority: Priority, operation: @escaping @Sendable () async -> Void) {
        priorityQueue.insert(.init(priority: priority, operation: operation))
        postWorkNotification.yield()
    }
    func perform(priority: Priority, operation: @escaping @Sendable () async throws -> Output) async throws -> Output {
        try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { [weak self] continuation in
            Task { [weak self] in
                await self?.enqueue(priority: priority) {
                    continuation.resume(with: await Result {
                        async let value = operation()
                        return try await value
                    })
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

extension AsyncPriorityWorkQueue {
    struct Work: Comparable, Sendable  {
        let id = UUID()
        var priority: Priority
        var operation: @Sendable () async -> Void
        static func < (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool { lhs.priority < rhs.priority }
        static func == (lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool { lhs.id == rhs.id }
    }
}

extension Result where Failure == Error {
    init(_ operation: () async throws -> Success) async {
        do { self = .success(try await operation()) } catch { self = .failure(error) }
    }
}

final class Subscriptions {
    private var cancellations: [() -> Void] = []
    deinit { cancellations.forEach { $0() } }
    static func += <Value, Failure>(lhs: Subscriptions, rhs: Task<Value, Failure>) { lhs.cancellations.append(rhs.cancel) }
}
```

Josh presented how to write a view model as a single function. Writing code in this style enhances local reasoning and testability. Thinking of the logic in this way (even if you use a different framework) can help influence how you write code in a positive way.

```swift

import Combine
import UIKit

import PlaygroundSupport

typealias Input = (
    increaseFirst: AnyPublisher<Void, Never>,
    increaseSecond: AnyPublisher<Void, Never>
)
typealias Output = (
    firstValue: AnyPublisher<String, Never>,
    secondValue: AnyPublisher<String, Never>,
    total: AnyPublisher<String, Never>
)
typealias AddViewModel = (Input) -> Output

final class AddViewController: UIViewController {
    private var subscriptions: Set<AnyCancellable> = []
    init(viewModel: AddViewModel) {
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        let firstInputSubject = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
        let secondInputSubject = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
        let outputs = viewModel((
            increaseFirst: firstInputSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher(),
            increaseSecond: secondInputSubject.eraseToAnyPublisher()
        ))
        with(UIStackView(arrangedSubviews: [
            UIButton(type: .roundedRect, primaryAction: .init(title: "Increase First") { _ in firstInputSubject.send() }),
            UIButton(type: .roundedRect, primaryAction: .init(title: "Increase Second") { _ in secondInputSubject.send() }),
            with(UILabel()) { label in
                outputs.firstValue.sink { [label] value in label.text = value }.store(in: &subscriptions)
            },
            with(UILabel()) { label in
                 outputs.secondValue.sink { [label] value in label.text = value }.store(in: &subscriptions)
            },
            with(UILabel()) { label in
                outputs.total.sink { [label] value in label.text = value }.store(in: &subscriptions)
            }
        ])) { stack in
            stack.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
            stack.axis = .vertical
            stack.alignment = .leading
            view.addSubview(stack)
            NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
                view.centerXAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerXAnchor),
                view.centerYAnchor.constraint(equalTo: stack.centerYAnchor)
            ])
        }
    }
    @available(*, unavailable)
    required init?(coder: NSCoder) { fatalError("")}
}


func addViewModel(_ input: Input)-> Output {
    let firstValue = input.increaseFirst.map { _ in 1 }.scan(0, +).prepend(0)
    let secondValue = input.increaseSecond.map { _ in 1 }.scan(0, +).prepend(0)
    return (
        firstValue: firstValue.map(String.init(describing:)).eraseToAnyPublisher(),
        secondValue: secondValue.map(String.init(describing:)).eraseToAnyPublisher(),
        total: Publishers.CombineLatest(firstValue, secondValue)
            .map(+)
            .map(String.init(describing:))
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    )
}

PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(AddViewController(viewModel: addViewModel))

```

To code efficiently in this style, you'll need to build some infrastructure (e.g. `with` and `bind`) or bring it into your code with a Swift Package.

### Presentation: Actor reentrancy

We looked at the issue of actor reentrancy which is discussed at length in the original Actor proposal: https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0306-actors.md#actor-reentrancy

We did this by creating the original code example and then running as a unit test repeatedly.

Once we got to a failing state we implemented a Swift concurrency friendly Semaphore based on the open source library: https://github.com/groue/Semaphore/blob/main/Sources/Semaphore/AsyncSemaphore.swift 

Then we changed the test code so that it generated deadlocks. The complete example:

```swift
import XCTest

enum Judgement {
  case noIdea, goodIdea, badIdea
}

typealias Decision = Judgement


public final class AsyncSemaphore: @unchecked Sendable {
  
  private var count: Int
  
  init(count: Int) {
    precondition(count >= 0)
    self.count = count
  }
  
  private let _lock = NSRecursiveLock()
  private func lock() {
    _lock.lock()
  }
  private func unlock() {
    _lock.unlock()
  }
  private class Suspension: @unchecked Sendable {
    enum State {
      case suspended(CheckedContinuation<Void, Never>)
    }
    var state: State
    init(state: State) {
      self.state = state
    }
  }
  private var suspensions: [Suspension] = []
  
  deinit {
    precondition(suspensions.isEmpty)
  }
  
  public func wait() async {
    lock()
    count -= 1
    if count >= 0 {
      unlock()
      return
    }
    await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
      let s = Suspension(state: .suspended(continuation))
      suspensions.insert(s, at: 0)
      unlock()
    }
  }
  
  @discardableResult
  public func signal() -> Bool {
    lock()
    count += 1
    switch suspensions.popLast()?.state {
    case .suspended(let continuation):
      unlock()
      continuation.resume()
      return true
    default:
      unlock()
      return false
    }
  }
}

actor Person {
  var friend: Person?
  var opinion: Decision = .noIdea
  let semaphore = AsyncSemaphore(count: 1)
  
  func tell(_ opinion: Judgement, heldBy person: Person) async {
    
    if .random() {
      if opinion == .goodIdea {
        _ = await person.thinkOfABadIdea()
      } else {
        _ = await person.thinkOfAGoodIdea()
      }
    }
    
  }
  
  init(friend: Person? = nil, opinion: Decision) {
    self.friend = friend
    self.opinion = opinion
  }
  
  func thinkOfAGoodIdea() async -> Decision {
    await semaphore.wait()    
    defer {
      semaphore.signal()
    }
    opinion = .goodIdea
    await friend?.tell(opinion, heldBy: self)
    return opinion
  }
  
  func thinkOfABadIdea() async -> Decision {
    await semaphore.wait()
    defer {
      semaphore.signal()
    }
    opinion = .badIdea
    await friend?.tell(opinion, heldBy: self)
    return opinion
  }
}

final class Reent2Tests: XCTestCase {
  func testRace() async {
    let friend = Person(friend: nil, opinion: .noIdea)
    let person = Person(friend: friend, opinion: .noIdea)

    // deadlock!

    let a = await person.thinkOfAGoodIdea()
    XCTAssertEqual(Judgement.goodIdea, a)
      
    let idea = await person.thinkOfABadIdea()
    XCTAssertEqual(Judgement.badIdea, idea)
  }

}
```

A followup would be to see how to find the deadlock introduced with the locks in this way.

### Questions and Discussion

#### Interfacing to C and C++

Ed is working on protein folding visualization for Apple Vision Pro and wants to interface with some existing libraries that load pdb files. Carlyn gave him some advice about that:

https://www.whynotestflight.com/excuses/but-some-of-my-best-friends-are-c/

Also, these two repos:

- https://github.com/carlynorama/UnsafeExplorer/tree/471f563afe223e41c0a29e4dc5e4253508fa46ce

#### App Architecture

Allen had a question about how to take his App model object and use it with SwiftUI.

We talked about the new Observable macro and how you can use it to target older versions of iOS.

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/date/iso8601formatstyle

#### Fixing SwiftData Initialization Error

Monty was having trouble with his SwiftData app.

The hypothesis is that he needed to add a config. i.e.

```swift
let schema = Schema([
                Item.self,
            ])
            let modelConfiguration = ModelConfiguration(schema: schema, isStoredInMemoryOnly: false)
```

### Questions and Discussion

There were other other discussions about working remotely in teams, getting experience at hackathons and working on open source PRs.

#### Performance

We looked at a performance problem in an app.  First we looked at it with insturments and found that the main loop was running with 98% CPU, a battery destroyer. It was hard to figure out in insturments exactly why this was happening but it did eventually lead us to the SwiftUI `View` that was re-rendering.

Then we insturmented this view with:

```swift
    let _ = Self._printChanges()
```

After closer inspection, we found that the view was using a geometry reader and then putting that into the view as an environment object. That would cause the view to re-render causing the whole cycle to repeat in a tight loop.

Josh's suggestion was to use a environment value instead:

Create a windowSize value that can be inserted into the environment.:

```swift
    extension EnvironmentValues {
        var windowSize: CGSize {
            get { self[SizeEnvironmentKey.self] }
            set { self[SizeEnvironmentKey.self] = newValue }
        }
    }
```

Create a method that you can set the size with (from something like a geometry reader).

```swift    
    extension View {
        func insertSizeIntoEnvironment(_ size: CGSize) -> some View {
            environment(\.windowSize, size)
        }
    }
```

Any view can get access to the size with this:

```swift
@Environment(\.windowSize) private var size
```

This would prevent the rapid invalidation of views caused by constantly updating the environment object.

### Questions and Discussion

#### Apple AirPods and Vision Pro

Rainer notes that AirPod Pros give amazing sound for the small package they are in. He was wondering how they compare to Vision Pro. The consensus seemed to be that Vision Pro audio is better than AirPod Pro audio but not as good as AirPod Max audio.

#### Concurrency Isolation

We went through the points in https://www.massicotte.org/intro-to-isolation 

These include:

  - You can determine isolation from a types declaration
  - Sometimes you have to look at base types to get the answer
  - When you await you can change isolation
  - Closures can inherit isolation
  - You can opt out of isolation
  - Protocols can specify isolation and it has tricky consequences
  - SwiftUI only specifies the body property as `@MainActor` which can be confusing
  - Turn on complete checking to find out where your data races might be.

Josh showed several additional examples including several examples of how you can run into problems with view model isolation. The conversation then turned to state management more generally comparing different approaches.  We also talked about task inheritance and structured concurrency more generally.  Memorize this:

### Presentation: Generalized Pagination

Josh started project for handling pagination in a generalized way.

- Use an enumeration to handle loading, loaded(Content), error, empty states.
- Use https://pointfree.co `@CasePathable` to ergonomically handle the enum states.
- Make a generic type to handle the content and getting the next set of data.
- Make the pagination type conform to `RandomAccessCollection` and friends by projecting the underlying content array.
- Make a pagination manager using an actor that accepts closures for fetching data and synchronizing fetching calls and publishing result via an async stream. 

Source code TBD.

### Sequences Presentation

Josh gave a short presentation on iterating through grid composed of two grids.

```swift
func lazyCartesianProduct<X: Sequence, Y: Collection>(_ x: X, _ y: Y) -> some Sequence<(X.Element, Y.Element)> {
        x.lazy.flatMap { x in y.lazy.map { y in (x, y) } }
    }
    
func cartesianProduct<X: Sequence, Y: Collection>(_ x: X, _ y: Y) -> some Sequence<(X.Element, Y.Element)> {
    sequence(state: (
        column: x.makeIterator(),
        row: y.makeIterator(),
        currentColumn: Optional<X.Element>.none
    )) { state in
        state.currentColumn = state.currentColumn ?? state.column.next()
        let y = state.row.next() ?? {
            state.currentColumn = state.column.next()
            state.row = y.makeIterator()
            return state.row.next()
        }()
        return state.currentColumn.flatMap { x in y.map { y in (x, y) } }
    }

### Feature Presentation: VisionOS

Josh continued his VisionOS example from last year building a 3D style shooting game were you can knock down blocks by firing balls from a cannon. Some of the topics discussed included:

- Taking in game controller events
- Mapping these events to transforms that move the cannon
- Creating new entities with initial velocity and physics
- Dynamic and static entities. Dynamic entities were the blocks and the balls. The floor was static entity.
- Composing new components into the system. The example was to control the lifetime of fired balls so they disappear after a few seconds.

### Questions and Discusssion

#### Logging

Bob D looking into logging code from previous meetings and updating the SwiftUI navigation to the latest version (NavigationStack).

Some of the videos he found useful:

- WWDC 23 Video on Structured Logging https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10226
- Stewart Lynch video on Logging https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi6JRczGoME

Ray mentioned testing logging using a DI framework.

- https://github.com/tgrapperon/swift-dependencies-additions/blob/main/Sources/LoggerDependency/Logger.swift

Josh mentioned that with recent improvements to OSLog even without dependency injection or mocking you can write out the log to an array and check it in a test if you are interested in.


#### Buying a New Mac

One that we took note of was a macro system to cut down on initializer boilerplate.  1000 line code reductions in real projects.

#### Dimissing Windows in VisionOS

The key is doing this through the environment:

```swift
@Environment(\.dismissWindow) private var dismissWindow
```

Ed was having trouble doing this probably because he was calling it at the wrong time.

John B gave us a quick working example:

```swift
.onChange(of: showImmersiveSpace) { _, newValue in
    Task {
        if newValue {
            switch await openImmersiveSpace(id: "ImmersiveSpace") {
            case .opened:
                immersiveSpaceIsShown = true
                dismissWindow(id: "MainWindow")
            case .error, .userCancelled:
                fallthrough
            @unknown default:
                immersiveSpaceIsShown = false
                showImmersiveSpace = false
            }
        } else if immersiveSpaceIsShown {
            await dismissImmersiveSpace()
            immersiveSpaceIsShown = false
        }
    }
}
```

For completeness, this is how he shows the window though he notes that it should be factored out from the collision handler where it currently lives.  Hopefully, Ed can use this working example to get his own project working.

```swift
collisionSubscription = content.subscribe(to: CollisionEvents.Began.self) { [self]
    event in
    if event.entityA == lander {
        handleCollision()
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: DispatchTime.now() + 5) {
            Task {
                await dismissImmersiveSpace()
                openWindow(id: "MainWindow")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
