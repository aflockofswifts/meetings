### Questions and Discussion

There were other other discussions about working remotely in teams, getting experience at hackathons and working on open source PRs.

#### Performance

We looked at a performance problem in an app.  First we looked at it with insturments and found that the main loop was running with 98% CPU, a battery destroyer. It was hard to figure out in insturments exactly why this was happening but it did eventually lead us to the SwiftUI `View` that was re-rendering.

Then we insturmented this view with:

```swift
    let _ = Self._printChanges()
```

After closer inspection, we found that the view was using a geometry reader and then putting that into the view as an environment object. That would cause the view to re-render causing the whole cycle to repeat in a tight loop.

Josh's suggestion was to use a environment value instead:

Create a windowSize value that can be inserted into the environment.:

```swift
    extension EnvironmentValues {
        var windowSize: CGSize {
            get { self[SizeEnvironmentKey.self] }
            set { self[SizeEnvironmentKey.self] = newValue }
        }
    }
```

Create a method that you can set the size with (from something like a geometry reader).

```swift    
    extension View {
        func insertSizeIntoEnvironment(_ size: CGSize) -> some View {
            environment(\.windowSize, size)
        }
    }
```

Any view can get access to the size with this:

```swift
@Environment(\.windowSize) private var size
```

This would prevent the rapid invalidation of views caused by constantly updating the environment object.

### Questions and Discussion

#### Apple AirPods and Vision Pro

Rainer notes that AirPod Pros give amazing sound for the small package they are in. He was wondering how they compare to Vision Pro. The consensus seemed to be that Vision Pro audio is better than AirPod Pro audio but not as good as AirPod Max audio.

#### Concurrency Isolation

We went through the points in https://www.massicotte.org/intro-to-isolation 

These include:

  - You can determine isolation from a types declaration
  - Sometimes you have to look at base types to get the answer
  - When you await you can change isolation
  - Closures can inherit isolation
  - You can opt out of isolation
  - Protocols can specify isolation and it has tricky consequences
  - SwiftUI only specifies the body property as `@MainActor` which can be confusing
  - Turn on complete checking to find out where your data races might be.

Josh showed several additional examples including several examples of how you can run into problems with view model isolation. The conversation then turned to state management more generally comparing different approaches.  We also talked about task inheritance and structured concurrency more generally.  Memorize this:

### Presentation: Generalized Pagination

Josh started project for handling pagination in a generalized way.

- Use an enumeration to handle loading, loaded(Content), error, empty states.
- Use https://pointfree.co `@CasePathable` to ergonomically handle the enum states.
- Make a generic type to handle the content and getting the next set of data.
- Make the pagination type conform to `RandomAccessCollection` and friends by projecting the underlying content array.
- Make a pagination manager using an actor that accepts closures for fetching data and synchronizing fetching calls and publishing result via an async stream. 

Source code TBD.

### Questions and Discussion

### Sequences Presentation

Josh gave a short presentation on iterating through grid composed of two grids.

```swift
func lazyCartesianProduct<X: Sequence, Y: Collection>(_ x: X, _ y: Y) -> some Sequence<(X.Element, Y.Element)> {
        x.lazy.flatMap { x in y.lazy.map { y in (x, y) } }
    }
    
func cartesianProduct<X: Sequence, Y: Collection>(_ x: X, _ y: Y) -> some Sequence<(X.Element, Y.Element)> {
    sequence(state: (
        column: x.makeIterator(),
        row: y.makeIterator(),
        currentColumn: Optional<X.Element>.none
    )) { state in
        state.currentColumn = state.currentColumn ?? state.column.next()
        let y = state.row.next() ?? {
            state.currentColumn = state.column.next()
            state.row = y.makeIterator()
            return state.row.next()
        }()
        return state.currentColumn.flatMap { x in y.map { y in (x, y) } }
    }
}
```

It is also interesting to look at the product type defined in the algorithms library:

#### AI and Software Development

How is it changing what people are doing?

- https://www.kodeco.com/44206375-kodeco-podcast-putting-ai-to-use-in-software-development-v2-s2-e3


It is possible that the code quality is better for other languages such as Python and C++ because the corpus is larger.

### Questions and Discusssion


#### Apple Vision Pro Pre-orders

The process was a little bumpy but it sounded like everyone that wanted to get one was able to. It seems like the backlog now is only about a month.

#### Device Disposal

Apple has special equipment to disassemble devices so the materials can be properly recycled.

https://www.apple.com/environment/

#### Perception and Observation:

Josh showed us a new framework from pointfree.co that backports Observable by taking inspiration from the Swift open source library which uses system private interfaces (aka `_spi(SwiftUI)`) to implement observation. 

https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/129-perception-a-back-port-of-observable


Josh also gave us a link to an article that goes into depth about Observation:

### Feature Presentation: VisionOS

Josh continued his VisionOS example from last year building a 3D style shooting game were you can knock down blocks by firing balls from a cannon. Some of the topics discussed included:

- Taking in game controller events
- Mapping these events to transforms that move the cannon
- Creating new entities with initial velocity and physics
- Dynamic and static entities. Dynamic entities were the blocks and the balls. The floor was static entity.
- Composing new components into the system. The example was to control the lifetime of fired balls so they disappear after a few seconds.

### Questions and Discusssion

#### Logging

Bob D looking into logging code from previous meetings and updating the SwiftUI navigation to the latest version (NavigationStack).

Some of the videos he found useful:

- WWDC 23 Video on Structured Logging https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/10226
- Stewart Lynch video on Logging https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zi6JRczGoME

Ray mentioned testing logging using a DI framework.

- https://github.com/tgrapperon/swift-dependencies-additions/blob/main/Sources/LoggerDependency/Logger.swift

Josh mentioned that with recent improvements to OSLog even without dependency injection or mocking you can write out the log to an array and check it in a test if you are interested in.


#### Buying a New Mac

Be careful of using old machines that are connected to the Internet that aren't getting security updates.  Go to Apple Silicon if possible but recent Intel machines are still viable for a few more years. The important thing is getting security updates.

Some places to look from deals:

- https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac
- https://smalldog.com/


For those missing the touch pad, consider stream deck.

- https://www.elgato.com/us/en/s/welcome-to-stream-deck

#### Swift Package Preview

The Swift blog showcases some interesting packages.

- 	https://www.swift.org/packages/showcase.html

One that we took note of was a macro system to cut down on initializer boilerplate.  1000 line code reductions in real projects.

- https://swiftpackageindex.com/gohanlon/swift-memberwise-init-macro


#### Dimissing Windows in VisionOS

The key is doing this through the environment:

```swift
@Environment(\.dismissWindow) private var dismissWindow
```

Ed was having trouble doing this probably because he was calling it at the wrong time.

John B gave us a quick working example:

```swift
.onChange(of: showImmersiveSpace) { _, newValue in
    Task {
        if newValue {
            switch await openImmersiveSpace(id: "ImmersiveSpace") {
            case .opened:
                immersiveSpaceIsShown = true
                dismissWindow(id: "MainWindow")
            case .error, .userCancelled:
                fallthrough
            @unknown default:
                immersiveSpaceIsShown = false
                showImmersiveSpace = false
            }
        } else if immersiveSpaceIsShown {
            await dismissImmersiveSpace()
            immersiveSpaceIsShown = false
        }
    }
}
```

For completeness, this is how he shows the window though he notes that it should be factored out from the collision handler where it currently lives.  Hopefully, Ed can use this working example to get his own project working.

```swift
collisionSubscription = content.subscribe(to: CollisionEvents.Began.self) { [self]
    event in
    if event.entityA == lander {
        handleCollision()
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: DispatchTime.now() + 5) {
            Task {
                await dismissImmersiveSpace()
                openWindow(id: "MainWindow")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
