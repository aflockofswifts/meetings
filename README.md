### To OpenAI or Not

Carlyn talked about when it makes sense to generate your APIs using OpenAPI.

### Memory Safety

Ray F. did an exploration of the new Swift 6.2 strict memory enforcement.

- https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0458-strict-memory-safety.md

We started by enabling checking in the package.

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.2
```

And in the target:

```swift


.target(name: "uuid-exploration"),
        swiftSettings: [.strictMemorySafety(), .treatAllWarnings(as: .error)])
```

You can enable from the command line or as an argument in your Xcode project's build:

```none
  -strict-memory-safety
```
  
Then we fixed the warnings (errors) by adding `unsafe` to every place that required it.

```swift
unsafe withUnsafeMutableBytes(of: &random) { raw in
    let result = unsafe SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, 10, raw.baseAddress!)
    precondition(result == errSecSuccess)
}
```

### Exploring a Design System 

Going back to the homework from Josh.

- https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/building-a-design-system-at-genius-scan/
  

HTML/CSS are very good about separating semantics and style. SwiftUI, similarly can be decomposed into different parts.


As example consider this view which is all about content:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(0..<10) { i in
                LabeledContent {
                    Text("Title")
                        .font(.body)
                        .foregroundStyle(.red)
                    Text("Subtitle")
                    Text("Subsubtitle")
                    Text("Subsubsubtitle")
                } label: {
                    Label("hello", systemImage: "star.fill")
                }
                .labeledContentStyle(.verticalHierarchicalText)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The style is applied with a custom modifier and can be defined like so:

```swift  
struct HierarchicalLabeledContentStyle: LabeledContentStyle {
    var orientation: Axis = .horizontal
    var spacing: Double = .zero
    enum Constant {
        static let fontFromIndex: [Int: Font] = [ 1 : .body, 2: .caption2, 3 : .caption]
        static let shapeStyleFromIndex: [Int: AnyShapeStyle] = [ 1 : AnyShapeStyle(.primary), 2: nyShapeStyle(.secondary), 3 : AnyShapeStyle(.tertiary)]
    }

    func makeBody(configuration: Configuration) -> some View {
        let layout = switch orientation {
          case .horizontal: AnyLayout(HStackLayout(spacing: spacing))
          case .vertical: AnyLayout(VStackLayout(alignment: .leading, spacing: spacing))
        }
        HStack(spacing: 10) {
          configuration.label
                .alignmentGuide(.listRowSeparatorLeading) { $0[.trailing] + 10 }
  
            layout {
                var index = 0
                ForEach(subviews: configuration.content) { subview in
                    subview.font(Constant.fontFromIndex[index] ?? .footnote)
                        .foregroundStyle(Constant.shapeStyleFromIndex[index] ?? AnyShapeStyle(.quaternary))
                    let _ = index += 1
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To allow for ergonomic auto-completing modifiers:

```swift
extension LabeledContentStyle where Self == HierarchicalLabeledContentStyle {
    static var horizontal: Self {
        Self(orientation: .horizontal)
    }
    static var verticalHierarchicalText: Self {
        Self(orientation: .vertical)
    }
    static func verticalHierarchicalText(spacing: Double) -> Self {
        Self(orientation: .vertical, spacing: spacing)
    }
}
```

### Retro-computing

John Brewer informed us that Microsoft released the source code BASIC for the 6502.

- https://github.com/microsoft/BASIC-M6502

It is about 8000 lines and compiles for multiple platforms, including the Apple II, Commodore PET and others.


### UUID

Universal Unique IDs are an important part of application development are defined by RFC 4122 and is being updated in RFC 9562. See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html

The Foundation implementation is version 4 of RFC 4122 and contains 120 bits of randomness. Ray walked us through an extension that implements version 7 which uses Unix-based time so that UUIDs can be sorted in order.

The first thing we did was make a setter from a raw UInt128.  The first implementation looks like this:

```swift
extension UUID {
  @inlinable init(_ value: UInt128) {
    let v: uuid_t =
      (UInt8(value >> 120 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 112 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 104 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 96 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 88 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 80 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 72 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 64 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 56 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 48 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 40 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 32 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 24 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 16 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value >> 8 & 0xff),
       UInt8(value & 0xff))
    self = UUID(uuid: v)
  }
}
```

Turns out that this is only valid for little endian platforms (which is most everything these days) but might fail on an embedded platform.  Here is the final version:

```swift
import Foundation
    
extension UUID {
      
  var version: Int {
    Int((uuid.6 & 0xf0) >> 4)
  }
      
  enum Variant {
     case ncs, rfc9562, guid, future
   }
       
   var variant: Variant {
       switch (uuid.8 >> 4) & 0xf {
       case 0x0 ... 0x7: .ncs
       case 0x8 ... 0xb: .rfc9562
       case 0xc ... 0xd: .guid
       case 0xe ... 0xf: .future
       }
   }
      
  init(_ value: UInt128) {
    var bigEndian = value.bigEndian
    let t = withUnsafeBytes(of: &bigEndian) { raw -> uuid_t in
      raw.load(as: uuid_t.self)
    }
    self = UUID(uuid: t)
  }
      
  var value: UInt128 {
    var source = uuid
    var destination: UInt128 = 0        
    _ = withUnsafeBytes(of: &source) { src in
      withUnsafeMutableBytes(of: &destination) { dst in
        src.copyBytes(to: dst)
      }
    }        
    return Int(littleEndian: 42) == 42 ? destination.byteSwapped : destination
  }

  static func v7() -> UUID {
      let timestamp = UInt128(Date().timeIntervalSince1970 * 1000)
      var random = UInt128.zero
      withUnsafeMutableBytes(of: &random) { raw in
        let result = SecRandomCopyBytes(kSecRandomDefault, 10, raw.baseAddress!)
        assert(result == 0)
      }
        
      var value = UInt128(0x7000_0000_000000000000)
      value |= (timestamp & ((UInt128(1) << 48) - 1)) << 80
      value |= (random & ((UInt128(1) << 76) - 1))
        
      // Patch in the variant
      value &= ~(UInt128(0b11) << 62) // clear the two bits
      value |=  (UInt128(0b10) << 62) // set to 10
        
      return UUID(value)
    }
      
  var unixMilliseconds: UInt64? {
     guard version == 7 else { return nil }
     return UInt64((value >> 80) & ((UInt128(1) << 48) - 1))
   }
      
  var timestamp: Date? {
    guard let unixMilliseconds else { return nil }
    return Date(timeIntervalSince1970: TimeInterval(unixMilliseconds) / 1000.0)
  }
}

```

We also wrote some tests:

```swift
import Testing
import Foundation
@testable import uuid_exploration
    
@Suite struct UUIDTests {
  @Test func version() {
    let uuid = UUID()
    #expect(uuid.version == 4)
    #expect(uuid.timestamp == nil)
  }
      
  @Test func initialize() {
    let x = UUID(1)
    #expect(x.uuidString == "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001")
    #expect(x.value == 1)
        
    let y = UUID(0x112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00)
    #expect(y.uuidString == "11223344-5566-7788-99AA-BBCCDDEEFF00")
    #expect(y.value == 0x112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00)
  }
      
  @Test func generateUUID7() {
    let uuid = UUID.v7()
    #expect(uuid.version == 7)
    print(uuid.uuidString)
    print(uuid.timestamp!)
  }
}
```

We also tested with this web service:

### Making a Random Label

From Josh:

```swift
print(String(Int.random(in: 0..<Int.max), radix: 36).uppercased())
```

Alternatively:

```swift
print(ObjectIdentifier(a).debugDescription)
```

### Homework

### Emoji Game

Josh talked about a solution for the new apple emoji game.  The correspondance problem 
between emoji images and word solutions probably requires an LLM.

You can solve the word problem independently. An old game that Josh used a trie to 
solve the Boggle game. 

- https://github.com/joshuajhomann/Boggle-SwiftUI
    

A more generalized type of trie useful for the emoji game is a "compressed suffix trie" which can quickly match substrings.

### Vibe Coding in Xcode 26

We made an experimental Inventory app on macOS 26 and Xcode 26.  

Some thoughts:
- It put together mostly working code.
- It made some unfortunate design decisions (user defaults storage, monolithic file to store everything)
- We were able to correct the problems though it did put some things in the wrong file and forgot to  inject all of the dependencies.

### Optimizing Animation  

Allen had a question about animating sticks and spheres using SceneKit.  The spheres are animating
smoothly while the sticks attached to the spheres would jump into place at the end. The question was
how to make it smooth.  The issue was that he was rendering the sticks using billboards. The consensus 
recommendation was to use simple geometry (e.g. hexagonal rod) to render the sticks and let the system
handle it for you.

Aside: SceneKit has been deprecated in favor of Reality kit.

- https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/288/


### Result Building Arrays and Sets    
    

Josh notes that in many of his projects he defines a result builders to declaratively define
arrays.

Here is the result builder:

- https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0289-result-builders.md
    

Here is how you do it for array:

```swift
@resultBuilder
struct ArrayBuilder<Element> {
    typealias Expression = Element
    typealias Component = Array<Element>
    
    static func buildBlock(_ components: Component...) -> Component {
        buildArray(components)
    }
    static func buildExpression(_ expression: Expression) -> Component {
        [expression]
    }
    static func buildExpression(_ expression: Expression?) -> Component {
        expression.map { [$0] } ?? []
    }
    static func buildOptional(_ component: Component?) -> Component {
        component ?? []
    }
    static func buildEither(first component: Component) -> Component {
        component
    }
    static func buildEither(second component: Component) -> Component {
        component
    }
    static func buildArray(_ components: [Component]) -> Component {
        components.flatMap { $0 }
    }
    static func buildLimitedAvailability(_ component: Component) -> Component {
        component
    }
}
```

An extension improves the ergonomics.

```swift
extension Array {
    static func build(@ArrayBuilder<Element> _ make: () -> Self) -> Self {
        make()
    }
}
```

You can use it like this:

```swift
var b = true
var c: Int? = nil
let a = Array<Int>.build {
    1
    2
    c
    if b {
        3
    }
    if #available(iOS 26.0, *) {
        4
    }
}
```

Another compelling use case for result builders is declarative tests:

## 2025.05.31

We discussed some other meetups:
  * https://links.iosdevhappyhour.com
  * https://lu.ma/core-coffee
We discussed solving the [Valid Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/) problem and how the particulars of Swift's String implementation make this different than the solutions in other languages.
We discussed comparing normalized strings:
```swift
let chars: [Character] = ["a", "ä"]
extension Character {
    func isSemanticallyEquivalent(to other: Character) -> Bool {
//        String(self).compare(String(other), options: [.diacriticInsensitive, .caseInsensitive, .widthInsensitive], locale: .current) == .orderedSame
        String(self).folding(options: [.diacriticInsensitive, .caseInsensitive, .widthInsensitive], locale: .current) == String(other).folding(options: [.diacriticInsensitive, .caseInsensitive, .widthInsensitive], locale: .current)
    }
}
print(chars[0].lowercased() == chars[1].lowercased())
print(chars[0].isSemanticallyEquivalent(to: chars[1]))
```swift
Then how to solve the problem: First the indexing solution which shows how RandomAccessCollection works.  YUou should no use this solution in any language since index math is unsafe:
```swift
extension RandomAccessCollection where Element == Character  {
    var isPalindrome: Bool {
        let backwards = reversed()
        var front = indices.first
        var back = backwards.indices.first
        while let unwrappedFront = front, let unwrappedBack = back {
            front = self[unwrappedFront...].firstIndex(where: \.isLetter)
            back = backwards[unwrappedBack...].firstIndex(where:\.isLetter)
            guard let unwrappedFront = front, let unwrappedBack = back  else { return true }
            guard self[unwrappedFront].isSemanticallyEquivalent(to: backwards[unwrappedBack]) else {
                return false
            }
            front = front.map { self.index(after: $0) }
            back = back.map { backwards.index(after: $0)}
        }
        return true
    }
}
```
Next the iterator solution:
```swift
extension BidirectionalCollection where Element == Character {
    var isPalindrome2: Bool {
        var frontIterator = makeIterator()
        var backIterator = reversed().makeIterator()
        var matchCount = 0
        let length = count / 2
        while let front = frontIterator.next(where: \.isLetter), let back = backIterator.next(where: \.isLetter), matchCount < length  {
            guard front.isSemanticallyEquivalent(to: back) else {
                return false
            }
            matchCount += 1
        }
        return true
    }
}

private extension IteratorProtocol where Element == Character {
    mutating func next(where predicate: (Character) -> Bool) -> Character? {
        while let next = next(){
            if predicate(next){
                return next
            }
        }
        return nil
    }
}
```
And finally the functional solution:
```swift
extension String {
    var isPalindrome3: Bool {
        zip(
            lazy.compactMap { $0.isLetter ? $0 : nil },
            reversed().lazy.compactMap { $0.isLetter ? $0 : nil }
        ).prefix(count/2).allSatisfy { $0.isSemanticallyEquivalent(to: $1) }
    }
}
```

### Experiments with containerRelativeFrame    

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view/containerrelativeframe(_:alignment:)
    

```           
available length = ((container length - safe area) - (spacing x (count - 1))       
column length = available length / count
       
view length = (column length x span) + ((span - 1) x spacing)
```

Here is the code we experimented with:

```swift
    struct ContentView: View {
        var body: some View {
      ScrollView(.horizontal) {
       LazyHStack(spacing: 100) {
        ForEach(0..<20) { item in
         Rectangle()
          .fill([Color.red, .green, .blue][item % 3])
    //      .aspectRatio(3.0 / 2.0, contentMode: .fit)
          .frame(height: 100)
    //      .overlay(Color.yellow.opacity(0.5))
          
          .containerRelativeFrame(
           .horizontal, count: 3, span: 1, spacing: 100)
    //      .overlay(Color.blue.opacity(0.5))
        }
       }
      }
    //  .safeAreaPadding(.horizontal, 20.0)
        }
    }
    
    #Preview {
        ContentView()
    }
```

    var greeting = "Hello, playground"
    
    let systemSoundIDs: [SystemSoundID] = Array(1000...4000).map { SystemSoundID($0)}
    
    for id in systemSoundIDs {
    //    AudioServicesPlaySystemSoundWithCompletion(id) {
    //        print(id)
    //        return
    //    }
        AudioServicesPlaySystemSound(id)
        AudioServicesPropertyID(systemSoundIDs[0])
    }
```

### Why Chris Eidhof avoids Group
    
- https://chris.eidhof.nl/post/why-i-avoid-group/
    
SwiftUI works more consistently if you have a single stable view at the root of your hierarchy.

### SwiftUI and Identity    

```swift
// Single identity
// .clear option becomes a no-op 
ViewWithState()
    .background(flag ? .red : .clear)
    .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 2), value: flag)
```

As Josh points out, you still get the space taken.

```swift    
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Image(systemName: "globe")
                .imageScale(.large)
                .foregroundStyle(.tint)
            Text("Hello, world!").opacity(0.0)
            Text("a")
        }
        .padding()
    }
}
```

### Async Discussion

When should you dispatch to the background?

No clear rule. Measure. An example from Josh:

```swift
import SwiftUI

@Observable
@MainActor
final class VM {
    var names: [String] = []
    func sort() async {
        async let sortedNames = { [names] in
            names.sorted()
        }()
        names = await sortedNames
    }
}
```

Peter brings up the point about re-entrancy. That leads to a discussion
about implementing switch map.

https://rxmarbles.com

- FlatMap in Combine is Merge Map
- FlatMap in AsyncAlgorithms is concatMap

There are many ways to flatten such as exhaustMap.

- https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/exhaustMap

Here is a manual way of doing it:

```swift
@Observable
@MainActor
final class VM {
    var names: [String] = []
    var sortTask: Task<[String], Error>?
    func sort() async {
        sortTask?.cancel()
        let sortTask = Task.detached { [names] in
            try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
            return names.sorted()
        }
        self.sortTask = sortTask
        do {
            names = try await sortTask.value
        } catch {
            switch error {
            case is CancellationError: print("task was canceled")
            default: print(error.localizedDescription)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Xcode Preview Bug

Ed filed feedback on Xcode previews always flipping back to their default (half screen) size.


### Benchmarking

How can you be sure that a better abstraction isn't slowing down your code too much. How can you
measure it?  It is a hard problem.

### Modular Apps
    
Mihaela MJ is working on a modular framework. Here is a working sample project

https://github.com/mihaelamj/Formidabble

### Design Patterns

It is always possible to convert between level and edge based events.

```swift
    Publishers.Merge(
        NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSApplication.willResignActiveNotification).map { _ in false },
        NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: NSApplication.willBecomeActiveNotification).map { _ in true }
    )
    .prepend(true)
```

Looking deeper at Patterns with Josh (such as the iterator pattern):


```swift
extension Sequence {
  static func +<Right: Sequence>(lhs: Self, rhs: Right) -> ConcatenatedSequence<Self, Right, Element> {
    ConcatenatedSequence(leftSequence: lhs, rightSequence: rhs)
  }
}
    
struct ConcatenatedSequence<Left: Sequence<Value>, Right: Sequence<Value>, Value>: Sequence {
  typealias Element = Value
  var leftSequence: Left
  var rightSequence: Right
  func makeIterator() -> Iterator {
      .init(leftIterator: leftSequence.makeIterator(), rightIterator: rightSequence.makeIterator())
  }
  struct Iterator: IteratorProtocol {
      typealias Element = Value
      var leftIterator: Left.Iterator
      var rightIterator: Right.Iterator
      mutating func next() -> Value? {
          leftIterator.next() ?? rightIterator.next()
      }
  }
}
    
let a = [1,2,3] + Set([4,5,6])
for value in a {
    print(value)
}
``` 

```swift
extension Sequence {
  static func +(lhs: Self, rhs: some Sequence<Element>) -> some Sequence<Element> {
    sequence(
        state: (
                leftIterator: lhs.makeIterator(),
                rightIterator: rhs.makeIterator()
        )
    ) { state in
          state.leftIterator.next() ?? state.rightIterator.next()
    }
}
```

Someone mentioned that Claude is good for interactive Vibe coding.

### Presentation: GoF: Design Patterns in Swift

Josh H. presented about the classic "Gang of Four" Design patterns--it is a common lexicon that can be used
to communicate with other developers or even machines using prompts.


#### Creational Patterns

These focus on object creation mechanisms, promoting better encapsulation and system independence.
    
- **Factory Method:** Defines an interface for creating objects, letting subclasses decide the class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory:** Provides an abstract factory class that creates families of related objects.
- **Builder:** Separates object construction from its representation, enabling different representations through the same process.
- **Prototype:** Creates objects by cloning existing instances rather than using constructors.
- **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.
    
#### Structural Patterns

These focus on how classes and objects can be composed to form larger structures.

- **Adapter:** Converts an interface to another, allowing incompatible classes to work together.
- **Decorator:** Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by wrapping them in decorator classes.
- **Proxy:** Acts as a placeholder for an object, controlling access and handling tasks like lazy loading.
- **Facade:** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system, reducing exposed complexity.
- **Composite:** Treats individual and composite objects uniformly, useful for tree structures.
- **Flyweight:** Shares data among multiple objects to reduce memory usage.
    

#### Behavioral Patterns
    
These focus on how classes interact and the responsibilities of objects within a system.

- **Strategy:** Encapsulates algorithms, allowing selection at runtime based on conditions.
- **Observer:** Establishes a one-to-many dependency, notifying dependents of state changes.
- **State:** Changes object behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
- **Command:** Encapsulates requests as objects for operations like logging and undo/redo.
- **Iterator:** Accesses aggregate elements sequentially without exposing the structure.
- **Mediator:** Reduces coupling between classes by encapsulating interactions.
- **Memento:** Captures and restores object state, useful for undo/redo functionality.
- **Visitor:** Adds methods to objects without changing their classes, useful for operations across sets of objects.
- **Template Method:** Defines an algorithm skeleton in a base class, letting subclasses implement specific steps.
    

### Other Patterns

Peter mentioned a pattern that he has been looking into

Alex mentioned one of his favorites: "Inversion of Control 🙂"

### Swift Evolution

Related to Swift testing, this proposal means you can use a short description with spaces and punctuation 
as the name of your test:

Josh also taked about a new addition to the language which lets you better hide implementation details.
  
- https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0409-access-level-on-imports.md


### Swift Packages    

Talked about modularization.

You can set the library type to statically or dynamically link packages.

CoreData in packages needs to be handled specially: https://ishabazz.dev/blog/2020/7/5/using-core-data-with-swift-package-manager
    

### Other discussion
    
From Ed returning integers as a blob of bytes:

```swift
extension FixedWidthInteger {
  var data: Data {
    let data = withUnsafeBytes(of: self) { Data($0) }
    return data
  }
}
```

From Josh (another way to deserialize)

```swift
enum JSON {
    indirect case array([JSON])
    indirect case dictionary([String: JSON])
    case boolean(Bool)
    case number(Double)
    case string(String)
    case null
}
    
extension JSON: Decodable {
    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {
        self = try Result { try decoder.singleValueContainer() }
            .flatMap { container in
                container.decodeNil()
                    ? .success(JSON.null)
                    : Result { JSON.boolean(try container.decode(Bool.self)) }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.number(try container.decode(Double.self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.string(try container.decode(String.self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.array(try container.decode([JSON].self)) } }
                        .flatMapError { _ in Result { JSON.dictionary(try container.decode([String: JSON].self)) } }
             }.get()
    }
}

### Presentation: Recent Swift Evolution Topics

MutableSpan: https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0467-MutableSpan.md

To understand borrowing and consuming we looked at some of the 

```swift
static func embiggened(_ value: [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var mutableValue = value
    for index in mutableValue.indices {
        mutableValue[index] += 1
    }
    return mutableValue
}

static func embiggened(byBorrowing value: borrowing [Int]) -> [Int] {
    var mutableValue = copy value
    for index in mutableValue.indices {
        mutableValue[index] += 1
    }
    return mutableValue
}
static func embiggen(byExclusiveBorrow value: inout [Int]) {
    for index in value.indices {
        value[index] += 1
    }
}
static func embiggen(byConsuming value: consuming [Int]) -> [Int] {
    for index in value.indices {
        value[index] += 1
    }
    return consume value
}
    
let a = [1, 2, 3]
let b = embiggen(byConsuming: a)
print(a,b)
```    

### Presentation: Replacing Combine with Modern Concurrency

Josh continued with a topic from last week about how to replace combine
with modern Swift concurrency. This week Josh created a `Pipe` abstraction
to allow multiple observers of a sent value (much like notification center).

```swift
import Foundation
import Synchronization
    
public final class Pipe<Value: Sendable>: Sendable, AsyncSequence {
    public typealias Stream = AsyncStream<Element>
    public typealias AsyncIterator = Stream.AsyncIterator
    public typealias Element = Value
    private let lockedContinuations: Mutex<[UUID: Stream.Continuation]>
    private let replayCount: Int
    public init(replay: Int = 0) {
        replayCount = replay
        lockedContinuations = .init([:])
    }
    deinit {
        lockedContinuations.withLock { continuations in
            continuations.values.forEach { $0.finish() }
        }
    }
    public func send(_ value: Value) {
        lockedContinuations.withLock { continuations in
            continuations.values.forEach { $0.yield(value) }
        }
    }
    
    public func makeAsyncIterator() -> AsyncIterator {
        let (stream, continuation) = Stream.makeStream(of: Element.self,
                bufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(replayCount))
        let id = UUID()
        continuation.onTermination = { [weak self] _ in
            self?.lockedContinuations.withLock { $0[id] = nil }
        }
        lockedContinuations.withLock { $0[id] = continuation }
        return stream.makeAsyncIterator()
    }
}
```

### Presentation (Josh): Removing @StateObject

Previously, Josh demostrated how SwiftUI can use Combine to achieve lazy initialization
and prevent repeated re-initialization of a view model of a view in a timeline view
using StateObject.

Inspired by this blog post:

- https://fatbobman.com/en/posts/lazy-initialization-state-in-swiftui/
    

Josh created a special property wrapper ViewModel that does the same thing and means 
you don't need to use StateObject or derive from Combine's ObservableObject.


```swift
import SwiftUI
import PlaygroundSupport
    
PlaygroundPage.current.setLiveView(ContentView())
    
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        TimelineView(.periodic(from: .now, by: 3)) { _ in
            let _ = print("-----------\(Date.now)-----------")
            V()
        }
    }
}
    
struct V: View {
    var vm = VM("naked var")
    @State var vm0 = VM("@State")
    @ViewModel var vm1 = VM("@ViewModel")
    var body: some View {
        Text(vm.text)
        Text(vm0.text)
        Text(vm1.text)
    }
}
    
@Observable
final class VM {
    var text: String
    init(_ text: String) {
        self.text = text
        print("Init \(text)")
    }
    deinit {
        print("Deinit \(text)")
    }
}
```    

Here is the property wrapper:

```swift
@propertyWrapper

### FOSDEM

There were a lot of Swift topics presented at this years FOSDEM (Free Open Source Developers European Meeting) that have been
organized for viewing here:

- https://swiftlang.github.io/event-fosdem/

### SwiftUI Fundamentals

A new book about SwiftUI from Natalia Panferova of nilcoalecing is available. Bob DeLaurentis says that it does a great job in 
explaining some of the subtleties of the framework.

### Electronic Readers

This led to a discussion about books and apps for reading ebooks.

### Forward Progress and Concurrency

Led by Peter and Josh, we discussed concurrency and the tools to guarantee forward progress.

- https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0433-mutex.md


To visualize / test restricting cooperative thread pool:  https://alejandromp.com/development/blog/limit-swift-concurrency-cooperative-pool/

A key insight is the ability to use `LIBDISPATCH_COOPERATIVE_POOL_STRICT=1` to make sure forward progress is always being made.

This is the thread on forum that goes in-depth on lock ownership and safety in using across suspension point https://forums.swift.org/t/incremental-migration-to-structured-concurrency/54939/5

### New Isolation Guarantees
    
Josh gave us a tour of proposal 0461 and how it makes things more similar between sync and async methods.

- https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0461-async-function-isolation.md
    

```swift
import Foundation
    
final class Q {
    func sync() {
        MyActor.assertIsolated()
        print("synchronous Q")
    }
    nonisolated func nonSync() async {
        MyActor.assertIsolated()
        print("asynchronous Q")
    }
}
    
@MyActor
final class P {
    var q = Q()
    func doStuff() async {
        q.sync()
        async let v = q.nonSync()
        let _ = await v
    }
}
    
@globalActor
actor MyActor: GlobalActor {
    static let shared = MyActor()
    private init() { }
}
    
Task {
    let p = await P()
    await p.doStuff()
}
```

### Apple Vision Pro Meeting

Apparently there was an interesting (mostly non-code meeting) by Apple last week about
how to develop "experiences" of vision pro. Ed atteneded online and John B was there in-person.
Four sessions over the course of the day.

Apparently they had a demo where they showed how to render the experience of being on the moon.

```none

    Geometry: 20K-500K total triangles
    View: -100K triangles per camera angle
    Memory: Less than 250MB total texture data

### Concurrency in Legacy Code

Questions from Rainer about how to use concurrency effectively in legacy code.

We talked about where things run and how the default might change in future versions
of Swift.


Link from Peter:

- https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/mainactor/assertisolated(_:file:line:)

Examples from Josh:

```swift
struct A {
    //@MainActor
    nonisolated func a() {
        Task {
            MainActor.assertIsolated()
        }
    }
}

Task {
     A().a()
}


```

Instead of falling back to using Combine (which bring tech debt with it), a suggestion from Josh to make
simple abstractions to avoid creating Tasks everywhere.

    
```swift
extension AsyncSequence where Failure == Never {
    func subscribe<Unretained: AnyObject>(withUnretained object: Unretained, onNext: @escaping (Unretained, Element) -> Void) -> Task<Void, Never> {
        Task { [weak object] in
            for await value in self {
                guard let object else { return }
                onNext(object, value)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Can be used like this:

```swift
actor A {
    var subscription: Task<Void, Never>?
     func a()  {
         let (output, input) = AsyncStream.makeStream(of: Int.self, bufferingPolicy: .bufferingNewest(1))
         subscription = output.subscribe(withUnretained: self) { unretained, value in
             print(unretained, value)    
         }
         input.yield(1)
         input.yield(2)
         input.yield(3)
    }
}
```

        fileHandle.write(data)
        fileHandle.closeFile()
      }

### Delphi Style Components

Starting with Package definitions. From MJ

```swift
// Dependency grouping
enum Dependencies {
    static var common: [Target.Dependency] {
        [
            .product(name: "Difference", package: "Difference"),
            .product(name: "LifetimeTracker", package: "LifetimeTracker"),
        ]
    }
}

    .target(
         name: "SharedModels",
         dependencies:
            Dependencies.common + [
                "AutomaticSettings",
            ]
    ),
```

### SwiftUI View Builders


View builder returns some View which is a container view like `ConditionalContent`.

```swift    
struct W: View {
    let a: Int
    @ViewBuilder
    var body: some View {
        switch a {
        case ..<0: Text("Negative")
        case 0: Text("Zero")
        case 1... : Color.green
        default: EmptyView()
      }
    }
}
```
    

### SwiftUI Navigation Bug

Joe shared this SwiftUI navigation bug:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationStack {
            NavigationLink {
                Text("Do not tap back, you'll regret it")
                    .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)
                    .toolbarBackground(Color.orange, for: .navigationBar)
                    .toolbarColorScheme(.dark, for: .navigationBar)
            } label: {
                VStack {
                    Text("First page is the sweetest")
                }               
                .padding()
            }
            .navigationTitle("First Page")
            .toolbarBackground(.visible, for: .navigationBar)
            .toolbarBackground(Color.orange, for: .navigationBar)
            .toolbarColorScheme(.dark, for: .navigationBar)
        }
    }
}
```

### Sequencing Animations    
    

Sample from Josh:

```swift
    withAnimation(animation, completionCriteria: .logicallyComplete) {
                operation()
            } completion: {
                continuation.resume()
            }

### Hacking Problem
    

Puzzle from John Brewer

```swift
var test3 = [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -9, -6, 10, 1, -5]
print(largestSumSpan(array: test3)) // [10, 1]
var test4 = [-1, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -9, -6, 8, 1, -5]
print(largestSumSpan(array: test4)) // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
What is the best idiomatic Swift to handle this?

```swift    
print(missingPair([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))
9
```

There is a "trick" to this one which to xor all of the bits.

### Resources and SwiftPM

- Peter was able to make a common target that other targets could depend on.

Exciting announcement Carlyn let us know about is that Swift Build (used by Xcode)
is, as of today, an open source technology. It will support Windows and Linux.

Also, the official announcement:

https://www.swift.org/blog/the-next-chapter-in-swift-build-technologies/

We looked at conditional package inclusion. You can conditionalize based on
platform but it doesn't look like there are too many other options.

An example from Mihaela:

```swift
    .product(name: "ResChatHouUIKit", package: "ResChatHouUIKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.iOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatUIKit", package: "ResChatUIKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.iOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatHouAppKit", package: "ResChatHouAppKit", condition: .when(platforms: [.macOS])),
                    .product(name: "ResChatAppKitUI", package: "ResChatAppKitUI", condition: .when(platforms: [.macOS])),
                    ]
            ),
```

## 2025.01.03

### A functional solution to Ed's game
  * Ed is making a game where he needs to match n distinct items in a row.  Josh offered a solution in functional swift:
  * We start with an assumption that we have a node, a sequence of adjacencies that can transform a node into another node, and the number of distinct items we want to match
```swift
let n = 6
let adjacency: some Sequence<(Node) -> Node?>
let node: Node
```
![layout](materials/blocks.png)
  * We can express the algorithm we want to apply as a node represents a winning state if there is a way to transform it into a sequence of n distinct elements. or more formally:
![layout](materials/existential.png)
  * Equivalently in swift:
```swift
let isWon = adjacency.contains { [node, n] adjacency in
	Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))).count == n
}
```
  * We can further express our intent with the use of explanatory variables:
```swift
let isWon = adjacency.contains { [node, n] adjacency in
    let adjacentUnique = Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))
	let isWinningRun = adjacentUnique.count == n
	return isWinningRun
}
```
* Ed asked how to get the winning nodes.  We can do this by changing the operator to `compactMap`:
```swift
let winningSets = adjacency.compactMap { [node, n] adjacency in
    let adjacentUnique = Set(sequence(first: node) { adjacency(node)}.prefix(n))
	let isWinningRun = adjacentUnique.count == n
	return isWinningRun ? adjacentUnique : nil
}
.reduce(into: Set<Node>()) { $0.formUnion($1) }
```

### Mine sweeper continued
* We updated the Layout to use a cache and added a viewModel:
```swift
@Observable
final class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private(set) var cells: Grid2D<Cell> = .init(rows: 8, columns: 8) { x, y in
        .init(id: x + y * 8, position: .init(x, y), color: .allCases.randomElement()!)
    }
    func tap(index: SIMD2<Int>) {
        cells[index].color = .blue
    }
}

struct Cell: Identifiable, Hashable {
    let id: Int
    let position: SIMD2<Int>
    var color: ViewModel.BoardColor
}

extension ViewModel {
    enum BoardColor: Hashable, CaseIterable {
        case red, green, blue
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel()
    var body: some View {
        Board(dimension: 8) {
            ForEach(viewModel.cells.indices, id: \.self) { index in
                Group {
                    switch viewModel.cells[index].color {
                    case .red: Color.red
                    case .green: Color.green
                    case .blue: Color.blue
                    }
                }
                .onTapGesture {
                    viewModel.tap(index:  viewModel.cells[index].position)
                }
                .boardPosition(index)
            }
        }
    }
}

extension View {
    func boardPosition(_ position: SIMD2<Int>) -> some View {
        layoutValue(key: BoardPosition.self, value: position)
    }
    func boardPosition(x: Int, y: Int) -> some View {
        boardPosition(.init(x, y))
    }
}

struct Board: Layout {
    let dimension: Int

    func sizeThatFits(proposal: ProposedViewSize, subviews: Subviews, cache: inout Cache) -> CGSize {
        let size = proposal.replacingUnspecifiedDimensions(by: .zero)
        let minimumDimension = min(size.width, size.height)

    }
